  summary: This paper addresses concerns that current pipeline codes result in overly conservative designs for high-pressure
    subsea flowlines and steel catenary risers. It highlights the limitations of the traditional Barlow formula for thick-walled
    pipe and the resulting economic penalties in deepwater projects. It advocates for a shift toward limit state design based
    on actual burst strength to achieve cost-effective and reliable offshore infrastructure.
