Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out about something we have built that spans both sides of your practice — the structural/offshore engineering work and the maritime legal consulting.

We have developed an engineering AI assistant with deep context across diffraction analysis, API 579-1 plate and shell fitness-for-service, GoA structural design, and maritime casualty consulting. It handles the technical groundwork that currently absorbs your team's time.

A few concrete examples:

- AQWA/WAMIT panel model setup guidance, RAO interpretation, and QTF second-order load assessment — **10 minutes** vs 1–2 hours
- API 579-1 Part 9 crack assessment on a plate butt weld using the FAD approach — **30 minutes** vs 4–8 hours
- MAIB or NTSB report analysis with ISM Code non-conformity identification and root-cause taxonomy — **20 minutes** vs 3–6 hours
- Structured technical summary for admiralty proceedings, Daubert-compliant framing — **2–4 hours** vs 1–2 days

The maritime legal output is engineering technical analysis — not legal advice — but it gives your team a structured, evidence-based foundation that feeds directly into the legal process. COLREGs, Jones Act, P&I Club process, and MAIB/NTSB incident precedents are all in context.

One thing worth highlighting: the assistant gets better over time. In Phase 1 it already knows the standards and analysis methods. By Phase 3, once your project reports and case files are indexed, it starts answering questions grounded in your own history — *"Find comparable ISM Code violations across our last five casualty cases"* becomes instantly answerable. The longer it runs, the more it encodes your team's preferred methods and builds a precedent library specific to your practice.

The first step is a 30-minute live demo at no cost, using real questions from your structural and legal teams. If it delivers, the next step is a Teams chatbot — one for the structural/offshore team and one for maritime legal consulting — running in your existing channels.

Would you have 30 minutes available in the next week or two?
