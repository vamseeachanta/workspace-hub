Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something we have been building that I think your jumper and pipeline team would find genuinely useful.

We have developed an engineering AI assistant loaded with deep subsea context — not a generic chatbot, but one that understands ASME B31.8 wall thickness sizing, DNV-OS-F101 collapse checks, API 579-1 fitness-for-service assessments, and OrcaFlex output processing. The kind of repetitive technical groundwork that currently takes hours.

A few examples of what it handles in minutes rather than hours:

- Wall thickness sizing for a 12" X65 jumper at 5,000 ft WD and 3,000 psi — **under 2 minutes**
- FFS Level 1/2 screening for wall loss or dents in a rigid jumper — **15 minutes** vs 2–4 hours
- Extracting max tension and curvature envelope tables from OrcaFlex ASCII results — **5 minutes per case**
- GoA 100-yr metocean parameters and seismic loading criteria — **instant lookup**

The first step costs nothing — it runs on existing AI subscriptions. If it saves time, we move to a Teams chatbot that lives in your existing channels.

One thing worth highlighting: the assistant gets better over time. In Phase 1 it already knows the standards and calculation methods cold. By Phase 3, once your project documents are indexed, it starts answering questions grounded in your own design history — *"What wall thickness did we use on the last GoA rigid jumper?"* becomes instantly answerable. The longer it runs, the more it encodes your team's methods, terminology, and lessons learned.

I would like to show you a live 30-minute demo using real project-type questions from your team. No slides, no pitch deck — just answers to engineering questions you would normally spend half a day researching.

Are you free for 30 minutes in the next week or two?

Best regards,
[Your name]
