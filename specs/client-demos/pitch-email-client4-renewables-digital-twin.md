Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something we have built that I think your offshore wind engineering and operations teams would find genuinely useful.

We have developed an engineering AI assistant with deep context across floating and fixed offshore wind — FOWT mooring analysis, OrcaFlex model setup, structural health monitoring configuration, metocean site data access, and simulation results analytics. It draws on real standards context (DNV-ST-0119, DNV-ST-0126, IEC 61400-3-2) and live environmental datasets, so answers are grounded rather than generic.

A few concrete examples of what it handles in minutes:

- DNV-ST-0119 mooring safety factor check for a 15 MW semi-sub at a target water depth and storm condition — **10 minutes** vs 1–2 hours
- Configure a DNV-ST-0126 compliant SHM sensor suite for a monopile foundation: blade strain gauges, tower accelerometer, foundation tilt sensors with alert thresholds — **10 minutes** vs 1–2 hours
- Retrieve ERA5 100-yr Hs and Tp for any offshore site location from the 1940-to-present hindcast archive — **5 minutes** vs 1–2 hours
- Generate a 80-turbine array layout with Jensen wake model AEP estimate and inter-array cable routing — **30 minutes** vs 4–8 hours
- Upload OrcaFlex time-history CSV results and get automatic anomaly detection on mooring tension across all load cases — **20 minutes** vs 2–4 hours

It also covers the asset integrity side: API 579-1 FFS assessments for tower or monopile wall loss, S-N fatigue with rainflow counting, and remaining life projections. The same assistant supports both the design phase and the in-service monitoring phase.

The first step is a 30-minute live demo at no cost — using real questions from your wind engineering and operations teams. If the time savings stack up, the next step is a Teams chatbot with separate context for your design engineers and your operations/monitoring team.

Would you have 30 minutes available in the next week or two?
