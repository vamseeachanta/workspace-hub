Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something we have built that I think your engineering teams would find genuinely useful across the well, reservoir, and integrity disciplines.

We have developed an engineering AI assistant loaded with deep O&G context — not a generic chatbot, but one that understands Bourgoyne-Young ROP modelling, API 579-1 fitness-for-service assessments, DNV-RP-F105 free span VIV calculations, and Arps decline curve forecasting. It also has direct access to BSEE GoM production data, EIA shale analytics, and NOAA metocean records.

A few examples of what it handles in minutes:

- Fit an Arps decline curve to production history and forecast 5-year EUR — **10 minutes** vs 2–4 hours
- Design a casing string for a 12,000 ft well with specified mud weight and shut-in pressure — **20 minutes** vs 2–4 hours
- API 579-1 Level 1/2 FFS screening for a corroded pipeline section, B31G vs RSTRENG comparison — **15 minutes** vs 2–4 hours
- DNV-RP-F105 allowable span calculation for a given pipe size and water depth — **5 minutes** vs 1–2 hours
- BSEE GoM production lookup, decline benchmarking against comparable fields — **instant**

The assistant covers the full breadth of a general O&G practice: drilling design, reservoir analytics, pipeline integrity, regulatory compliance, and incident analysis. We can configure it with the specific standards and codes your teams work to most.

The first step is a 30-minute live demo at no cost — no slides, no pitch deck, just answers to real questions from your engineering teams. If the time savings stack up, the next step is a Teams chatbot that lives in your existing channels, with a separate context for each discipline team.

Are you free for 30 minutes in the next week or two?

Best regards,
[Your name]
