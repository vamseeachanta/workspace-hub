# Objective
Create a comprehensive economic brief for the Shenandoah field that captures true costs, partner exposures, historical write-offs, and current development economics.

# Tasks
1. Summarize the complete timeline of Shenandoah ownership and capital events from discovery through first production, highlighting all partner changes.
2. Quantify every disclosed impairment, write-off, or suspended cost by partner (e.g., Anadarko, Cobalt, ConocoPhillips) with dates and SEC filings or earnings-call references.
3. Detail purchase considerations and valuations for all major transactions (Cobalt bankruptcy sale, LLOG/Beacon/Navitas deals, Beacon’s acquisition of LLOG’s stake, FID valuation).
4. Reconcile exploration and development spend with reported project valuations (field value vs. what each company carried on its books) to surface discrepancies.
5. Provide the latest development cost estimates (e.g., the reported $1.8 B CAPEX at FID), operating assumptions (start-up 2025, facility concept, drilling campaign), and break-even analysis if available.
6. Compile a partner matrix listing historical and current working-interest owners, operatorship status, and financial obligations/carry arrangements.
7. Note any public disputes, whistleblower claims (e.g., Lea Frye’s warnings), or regulatory filings that influenced valuation or impairments.

# Source Material to Incorporate
- Anadarko Petroleum 2017 impairment of ~$467 M and expensing of ~$435 M suspended exploratory costs (stock drop context).
- Cobalt International Energy ~$235 M losses and $232.8 M write-off tied to Shenandoah before 2017 bankruptcy.
- 2018 Cobalt bankruptcy auction: LLOG Exploration, Beacon Offshore, Navitas Petroleum acquiring 70% working interest for $1.8 M; Anadarko and ConocoPhillips exit (33% and 30% interests).
- 2020 transaction: Beacon Offshore (via Blackstone) acquiring LLOG’s 31% stake for an implied $250 M valuation and assuming operatorship.
- 2021 Final Investment Decision for ~$1.8 B development; production start in 2025.

# Deliverables
- An executive summary highlighting economic inflection points and total capital invested vs. recovered.
- Detailed tables for impairments/write-offs and transaction valuations by stakeholder.
- A partner timeline diagram or narrative mapping ownership percentages over time.
- Current outlook section describing project economics, cost structure, and remaining uncertainties.

# Constraints & Expectations
- Cite all publicly available sources (SEC filings, bankruptcy docs, press releases, investor presentations, reputable news outlets).
- Distinguish clearly between confirmed figures and estimates/industry commentary.
- Emphasize discrepancies between field-level economics and individual company accounting treatments.
- Include all known partners and financial participants across the project lifecycle.

# Open Questions
- Are there updated CAPEX/OPEX estimates post-2021 FID?
- Did any partners secure insurance recoveries or tax benefits tied to the impairments?
- What are current production targets vs. original discovery expectations?

# Other Questions

- For the IRR and other calcuations, create a detailed budget and assumed future cashflow to demonstrate detailed calculations

- Is the 1.8 B quoted, - is it total share or Beacon's share? research thoroughly and let me know.
