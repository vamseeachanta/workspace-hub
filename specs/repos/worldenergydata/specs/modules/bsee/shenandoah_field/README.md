## Complete Research Brief & Financial Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive **asset lifecycle and societal economics analysis** of the **Shenandoah deepwater oil field** in the Gulf of Mexico, covering the complete cycle from discovery (2009) through first production (2025).

**Central Question:** Does distressed asset recycling create value for society and the O&G industry, or does it simply transfer wealth between investor classes?

**Key Finding:** The field demonstrates **value transfer, not value creation** at societal level. While new partners earn 37% IRR, all-in project IRR is only **4-5%** (below hurdle rate) when including $3.5B in sunk costs from original partners. Total capital deployed: **$5.9 billion** over 22 years.

## 🚀 Next Steps & Open Questions

### Data Gaps (High Priority)
1. ConocoPhillips' undisclosed losses on 30% WI
2. LLOG's total capital invested (2018-2020)
3. HEQ Deepwater and BOE II entry terms
4. Actual operating costs now that field is producing
5. Detailed Shen-3 dry hole results

### Recommended Follow-up Analysis
1. Retrieve and analyze full SEC filings (Anadarko 10-K 2017, Cobalt 10-Q Q1 2017)
2. Compare Shenandoah economics to peer deepwater projects (Mad Dog 2, Appomattox, Anchor)
3. Analyze whistleblower protection effectiveness in O&G industry
4. Model break-even economics under various oil price scenarios
5. Track actual vs. predicted production performance post-startup

### Legal Status Updates Needed
1. Current status of Norfolk County Council v. Anadarko after 5th Circuit remand
2. Outcome of Lea Frye's NDA declaratory judgment case
3. SEC enforcement actions (if any) following Frye's 2016 complaint
4. BSEE regulatory review of reserve reporting practices

## 🎓 Key Lessons for Deepwater Development

1. **Reserve Estimation:** Single appraisal wells insufficient; Paleogene reservoirs require conservative approach
2. **Whistleblower Value:** Early technical dissent (Lea Frye 2014) proved more accurate than management guidance
3. **Commodity Timing:** Same reservoir, different economics: Majors entered at peak costs/low prices; PE entered at trough
4. **Technology Risk:** 20k psi high-pressure development successfully deployed by independents after majors exited
5. **Governance Matters:** Disconnect between technical assessments and investor communications destroyed $1.4B in value
