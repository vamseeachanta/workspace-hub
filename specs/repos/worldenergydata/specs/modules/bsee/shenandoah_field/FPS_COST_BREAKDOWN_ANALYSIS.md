## PART 2: BUDGET MODEL RECONCILIATION

### Current Budget Model Allocation

From `detailed_budget_model.md`:

| Component | Current Budget | % of $1.8B | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Floating Production System | **$700M** | 38.9% | "120k BOPD semi-sub, built in S. Korea" |
| Subsea Infrastructure | **$250M** | 13.9% | "Trees, flowlines, umbilicals, manifolds" |
| **FPS + Subsea Total** | **$950M** | **52.8%** | **Combined facility costs** |

### Actual Contract Allocation

| Component | Actual Contract | Contractor | Contract Scope |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| FPS Fabrication | **$576.44M** | Hyundai Heavy Industries | Design, procurement, construction, delivery to US |
| Installation (Bundled) | **$150-300M** | Subsea 7 | Subsea infrastructure + FPS tow/mooring/hook-up |
| **Total Facility Costs** | **$726-876M** | | **Actual contracted amounts** |

### Reconciliation Analysis

**Scenario A: Low End ($150M installation)**
- FPS Fab: $576M
- Installation: $150M
- **Total: $726M** (vs. $950M budget = **$224M under**)

**Scenario B: High End ($300M installation)**
- FPS Fab: $576M
- Installation: $300M
- **Total: $876M** (vs. $950M budget = **$74M under**)

**Most Likely Case: Mid-Range ($225M installation)**
- FPS Fab: $576M
- Installation: $225M
- **Total: $801M** (vs. $950M budget = **$149M contingency/margin**)

### Where is the $700M FPS Figure Coming From?

**Analysis:** The $700M FPS line item likely includes:
- $576M Hyundai fabrication contract (confirmed)
- $124M for additional FPS-related costs:
  - Design and engineering (FEED)
  - Project management
  - Transport from Korea to Ingleside, TX (COSCO shipping)
  - Spares and commissioning equipment
  - Owner's costs and contingency

This is REASONABLE and industry-standard practice.

## PART 4: COMPARISON TO JACK ST. MALO BENCHMARK

### Jack St. Malo FPS Cost Breakdown

From EIA 2016 Cost Study (user-provided):
- **Total JSM Semisubmersible Platform**: $1.5 billion (2010 dollars)
- **Capacity**: 170,000 BOPD
- **Scope**: Complete FPS including fabrication and installation

**Component Estimate for JSM** (typical deepwater semi-sub breakdown):

| Component | JSM Cost (est.) | % of $1.5B | Shenandoah Scaled | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Hull Fabrication** | $600M | 40% | $420M | Fabricated in S. Korea |
| **Topside Fabrication** | $450M | 30% | $315M | Constructed in Ingleside, TX |
| **Towing & Transport** | $30M | 2% | $21M | From TX to field |
| **Mooring Installation** | $150M | 10% | $105M | Deepwater spread mooring |
| **Installation & Hook-up** | $180M | 12% | $126M | Offshore installation work |
| **Commissioning** | $90M | 6% | $63M | Start-up and testing |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,500M** | **100%** | **$1,050M** | **Six-tenths rule scaling** |

**Scaling Methodology:**
- JSM capacity: 170,000 BOPD
- Shenandoah capacity: 120,000 BOPD
- Six-tenths rule: Cost₂ = Cost₁ × (Capacity₂/Capacity₁)^0.6
- Scaling factor: (120,000/170,000)^0.6 = 0.811
- Scaled total: $1,500M × 0.811 = **$1,217M**

**Timing Discount (2021 vs 2010):**
- JSM FID: 2010 (peak oil prices, tight capacity)
- Shenandoah FID: 2021 (post-downturn, excess capacity)
- Estimated cost reduction: 20-30%
- Adjusted JSM benchmark: $1,217M × 0.75 = **$913M**

**Comparison:**
- Scaled JSM (2021 dollars): **$913M**
- Shenandoah budget (FPS + partial install): **$700-876M**
- Difference: **$37-213M** (4-23% lower)

**Conclusion:** Shenandoah costs are **reasonable** compared to scaled JSM benchmark, especially considering:
1. All-Korea fabrication (vs split Korea/Texas) = 10-15% savings
2. Simpler initial design (Phase 1 only 4 wells vs JSM 6 wells) = 5-10% savings
3. Technology maturity (2021 vs 2010) = 5-10% additional savings

## PART 5: RECOMMENDED BUDGET ALLOCATION

### Option 1: Maintain Current Structure (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale:** Public contract information does not provide sufficient detail to break out FPS installation components separately. Subsea 7 contract bundles all installation work together.

| Component | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Floating Production System** | **$700M** | Fabrication ($576M) + design, transport, owner's costs, contingency ($124M) |
| **Subsea Infrastructure** | **$250M** | Subsea equipment + installation (portion of Subsea 7 contract) |
| **TOTAL** | **$950M** | **Current budget allocation** |

**Advantages:**
- Matches FID announcement structure
- Reflects actual contract award packages
- Avoids speculative cost allocation without public data
- Maintains $149M contingency buffer vs actual contracts

**Disadvantages:**
- Does not show component-level detail for FPS installation
- Mooring, towing, hook-up costs "hidden" in Subsea Infrastructure line

---

### Option 2: Detailed Component Breakdown (ESTIMATED)

**Rationale:** If detailed cost tracking is required for internal analysis, use industry benchmark estimates to allocate installation costs.

| Component | Amount | % of Phase 1 | Source / Basis |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. FPS Fabrication** | | | |
| - Hull Fabrication | $300M | 16.7% | Hyundai contract (est. hull portion) |
| - Topside Fabrication | $240M | 13.3% | Hyundai contract (est. topside portion) |
| - Transport Korea → Texas | $15M | 0.8% | COSCO heavy-lift vessel |
| - Engineering & Owner's Costs | $21M | 1.2% | FEED, project management |
| **Subtotal FPS Fabrication** | **$576M** | **32.0%** | **Confirmed Hyundai contract** |
| | | | |
| **2. FPS Installation** | | | |
| - Wet Tow (Texas → Field) | $20M | 1.1% | AHTS vessel charter, ~150 nm |
| - Mooring System Installation | $75M | 4.2% | 5,800 ft depth, 8-12 point spread mooring |
| - FPS Hook-up & Commissioning | $38M | 2.1% | Riser/umbilical connection, testing |
| **Subtotal FPS Installation** | **$133M** | **7.4%** | **Portion of Subsea 7 contract (estimated)** |
| | | | |
| **3. Subsea Infrastructure** | | | |
| - Subsea Trees & Equipment | $60M | 3.3% | 4-well subsea trees (TechnipFMC) |
| - Flowlines & Risers | $45M | 2.5% | Production and gas export lines |
| - Umbilicals | $20M | 1.1% | Control and power umbilicals |
| - Subsea Manifold | $15M | 0.8% | 4-well manifold structure |
| - Installation (SURF) | $110M | 6.1% | Subsea infrastructure installation |
| **Subtotal Subsea Infrastructure** | **$250M** | **13.9%** | **Equipment + portion of Subsea 7 contract** |
| | | | |
| **TOTAL FPS + SUBSEA FACILITY COSTS** | **$959M** | **53.3%** | **Detailed component allocation** |

**Advantages:**
- Provides visibility into installation cost components
- Shows mooring, towing, hook-up costs explicitly
- Useful for comparative analysis with other projects
- Supports detailed NPV sensitivity analysis

**Disadvantages:**
- Based on industry estimates, not actual contract breakdowns
- May not reflect actual cost allocation between contracts
- Could create false precision in financial models
- Requires footnote that installation costs are estimates

- Connection to FPS mooring fairleads
- Tensioning and load balancing
- Mooring integrity testing

**Note:** This is part of the overall FPS hook-up operation ($30-45M total) which includes riser and umbilical connections. This cost is **bundled** in Subsea 7's installation contract.

---

### Question 5: Can we add these costs to facility costs as separate line items?

**Answer:** **NOT RECOMMENDED based on publicly available information.**

**Rationale:**

1. **Contract Structure:** Subsea 7's single contract ($150-300M) bundles:
   - Subsea infrastructure installation
   - FPS wet tow
   - Mooring installation
   - FPS hook-up
   - No public breakdown of cost allocation between these components

2. **Industry Practice:** Installation contractors typically do not disclose component-level pricing for competitive and risk management reasons.

3. **Current Budget Adequacy:** The current budget structure:
   - FPS: $700M (fabrication + margins)
   - Subsea Infrastructure: $250M (equipment + installation)
   - **Total: $950M** covers actual contracts ($726-876M) with $74-224M margin

4. **Recommendation:**
   - **For external reporting:** Maintain current 2-line structure (FPS + Subsea Infrastructure)
   - **For internal analysis:** Use Option 2 detailed breakdown with clear footnote that installation component costs are **estimates** based on industry benchmarks, not actual contract allocations

5. **Footnote Template:**
   ```
   "Installation costs (FPS towing, mooring, hook-up, and subsea infrastructure
   installation) are allocated based on industry benchmarks. Actual costs are
   bundled in a single Subsea 7 EPIC contract valued at $150-300M. Component
   estimates provided for analytical purposes only."
   ```
