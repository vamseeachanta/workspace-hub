## Detailed Breakdown by Perspective

### 1️⃣ NEW PARTNERS PERSPECTIVE (The 37% IRR You See in Reports)

**WHO:** Navitas (49%), Beacon/Blackstone (20.05%), HEQ (20%), BOE II (10.95%)

**THEIR MATH:**
```
Entry Investment (2018-2021):
  Navitas bankruptcy bid:         $1.8M
  Beacon LLOG acquisition:        $250M
  Development capital:            $2,400M
  Phase 2 expansion:              $350M
  ────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL NEW PARTNER CAPITAL:      $3,001M ≈ $3.0B

Expected Returns:
  Gross revenue (211 MMBOE @ $70): $14,770M
  Operating costs (@ $15/bbl):     -$3,165M
  ────────────────────────────────────
  NET CASH FLOW:                   $11,605M
  
  Less their capital:              -$3,001M
  ────────────────────────────────────
  NET PROFIT:                      $8,604M
  
Return Metrics:
  Multiple:       3.9x
  Cumulative ROI: 287%
  IRR:           37%
  Payback:       3.2 years
```

**WHY 37% IRR?**
- Acquired distressed asset for $1.8M (Navitas)
- Entered at commodity cycle bottom
- Development costs spread over 2021-2025
- Production starts 2025, cash flows 2025-2031
- Typical private equity time horizon (3-7 years)

### 2️⃣ ALL-IN PROJECT PERSPECTIVE (The Hidden Truth)

**WHO:** EVERY dollar invested by ANYONE from discovery (2009) to present (2025)

**THE FULL MATH:**
```
Total Capital Deployed (ALL Parties):
  Original exploration (2009-2017):  $1,800M+
  Write-offs recognized (2017):      $1,400M
  Redevelopment (2018-2020):         $300M
  Blackstone acquisition (2020):     $250M
  FID development (2021-2025):       $1,800M
  Phase 2 expansion (2025-2026):     $350M
  ────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL ALL-IN CAPITAL:              $5,900M

Capital Recovered to Date:
  Bankruptcy sale proceeds:          $1.8M
  LLOG exit (2020):                  $250M
  ────────────────────────────────────
  RECOVERED:                         $252M

Net Capital Still at Risk:           $5,648M

Expected Returns (Same as New Partners):
  Gross revenue:                     $14,770M
  Operating costs:                   -$3,165M
  ────────────────────────────────────
  NET CASH FLOW:                     $11,605M
  
  Less ALL capital ever deployed:    -$5,900M
  ────────────────────────────────────
  ALL-IN NET PROFIT:                 $5,705M

Return Metrics (2009-2031 timeframe):
  Multiple:       2.0x
  Cumulative ROI: 97%
  IRR:           4-5% (over 22 years)
  NPV @ 10%:     ~$1B (barely positive)
  NPV @ 15%:     NEGATIVE
```

**WHY SO LOW?**
- $3.2B+ spent by original partners with ZERO return
- Those sunk costs cannot be ignored in true project economics
- 22-year total timeframe (2009-2031) vs. 7 years for new partners
- Time value of money: $1 in 2009 ≠ $1 in 2025
- 4-5% IRR is BELOW typical 15% oil & gas hurdle rate

**INTERPRETATION:**
- Project is marginally economic on all-in basis
- Would NOT have been sanctioned if single operator from 2009
- Only economic because new partners excluded sunk costs

### 3️⃣ ORIGINAL PARTNERS PERSPECTIVE (The Losers)

**WHO:** Anadarko (33% WI), Cobalt (37% WI), ConocoPhillips (30% WI)

**THEIR MATH:**
```
Capital Deployed (2009-2017):
  Exploration & appraisal:          $1,800M+
  Sunk costs written off:           $1,400M disclosed
  ConocoPhillips (undisclosed):     $300M+ (estimated)
  ────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL ORIGINAL CAPITAL:           $3,500M+

Returns:
  Production revenue:               $0
  Asset sale proceeds:              $0
  ────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL RECOVERED:                  $0

Return Metrics:
  Multiple:       0.0x
  Cumulative ROI: -100%
  IRR:           -100%
  Capital lost:   $3,500M+
```

**WHY TOTAL LOSS?**
- Developed during worst part of commodity cycle (2015-2017)
- Oil prices: $43-51/bbl (below break-even)
- Aggressive reserve estimates proved wrong (Lea Frye was right)
- Shen-3 appraisal was dry hole
- No buyers at any price in 2017 downturn
- Forced to write off entire value

**OUTCOME:**
- Anadarko: $902M loss, CEO got $100M exit package
- Cobalt: $233M loss, bankruptcy, liquidation
- ConocoPhillips: Undisclosed loss, quiet exit

## Visual Comparison: Same Reservoir, Three Outcomes

```
                   CAPITAL IN          CASH OUT         RETURN
                   ──────────          ────────         ──────
NEW PARTNERS:      $3.0B          →    $11.6B      =    37% IRR ✅
ALL-IN PROJECT:    $5.9B          →    $11.6B      =    4-5% IRR ⚠️
ORIGINAL PARTNERS: $3.5B          →    $0          =    -100% ❌
```

---

## Why This Matters: The $37% IRR is NOT Lying, But It's Incomplete

### What the 37% IRR Tells You:
✅ New partners made a brilliant contrarian investment  
✅ Private equity timing + distressed asset expertise works  
✅ Entering at cycle bottom generates asymmetric returns  
✅ Same reservoir can have vastly different economics based on entry point  

### What the 37% IRR Hides:
❌ Society/investors collectively lost money on this asset  
❌ $3.5B was destroyed before new partners even arrived  
❌ True all-in project IRR is only 4-5% (below hurdle rate)  
❌ This was a VALUE TRANSFER, not value creation at project level

## The Economic Reality: Value Transfer, Not Value Creation

### Value Transfer Diagram
```
ORIGINAL PARTNERS          BANKRUPTCY SALE          NEW PARTNERS
$3.5B invested        →    $1.8M sale price    →    $11.6B cash out
$0 recovered               (99.95% loss)            $8.6B profit

┌─────────────┐           ┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│   -100%     │    →      │ Value reset  │    →    │    +37%      │
│  Total loss │           │   to zero    │         │ High returns │
└─────────────┘           └──────────────┘         └──────────────┘
```

**What Happened:**
- Original partners invested $3.5B, recovered $0
- New partners invested $3.0B, will recover $11.6B
- **Net value transfer: $8.6B from old to new partners**
- **Net value creation (all-in): $5.7B over 22 years = 4-5% IRR**

## Implications for Different Stakeholders

### For INVESTORS evaluating the asset:
- **Ask:** "What is the all-in project IRR including sunk costs?"
- **Don't be fooled by:** "37% IRR" without context
- **Reality check:** If all-in IRR is below hurdle rate, project would not be sanctioned today if starting from scratch

### For PRIVATE EQUITY:
- **Strategy validated:** Buy distressed assets at cycle bottom = asymmetric returns
- **Key skill:** Separate sunk costs from go-forward economics
- **Lesson:** Your IRR ≠ project IRR (and that's okay if you're disciplined buyer)

### For ORIGINAL PARTNERS:
- **Lesson:** Timing matters more than geology in cyclical assets
- **Mistake:** Developing at peak costs, minimum commodity prices
- **Governance failure:** Ignoring whistleblower (Lea Frye) cost $3.5B

### For SOCIETY/POLICY:
- **Question:** Is 4-5% all-in IRR efficient use of capital?
- **Concern:** Write-offs have tax implications (reduced government revenue)
- **Issue:** Executive compensation disconnected from outcomes ($100M CEO payout despite $902M loss)

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **Three IRRs, Three Stories**
| IRR | Story | Audience |
|-----|-------|----------|
| 37% | Private equity victory | Investors in new partners |
| 4-5% | Marginal project economics | Society, policymakers, economists |
| -100% | Complete failure | Original partner shareholders |

### 2. **Same Reservoir, Different Returns = Entry Timing**
- Oil at $45/bbl (2016): Project uneconomic → Write-off
- Oil at $70/bbl (2021): Project economic → FID
- **$25/bbl price difference = $5.3B swing in project economics**

### 3. **37% IRR is Marketing, 4-5% IRR is Reality**
- Marketing: "We're generating 37% returns!"
- Reality: "Society collectively earned 4-5% on $5.9B over 22 years"
- Both are true, but incomplete without the other

### 4. **Value Transfer ≠ Value Creation**
- New partners captured value that original partners destroyed
- Efficient capital recycling? Yes.
- Net value creation? Marginal (4-5% IRR).
- Wealth transfer? $8.6B from public market investors to PE investors

## CRITICAL WARNING FOR ANALYSIS USERS

### ⚠️ When You See "37% IRR" in This Analysis:

**IT MEANS:**
- Returns for NEW partners (2018-2025 entry) ONLY
- Excludes $3.5B in sunk costs by original partners
- Assumes oil prices remain at $70/bbl
- Based on 211 MMBOE reserves (Phase 1+2)

**IT DOES NOT MEAN:**
- All-in project returns from discovery (2009)
- Returns if you include original partners' losses
- Guaranteed returns (subject to oil price, reservoir, operational risk)
- That society benefited from 37% returns (all-in IRR is only 4-5%)

### ✅ Correct Usage:
- "New partners are projected to earn 37% IRR from their 2018-2021 entry"
- "Private equity strategy of distressed asset acquisition delivered 37% returns"
- "Shenandoah demonstrates value of contrarian investing at cycle bottoms (37% IRR)"

### ❌ Incorrect Usage:
- "Shenandoah is a 37% IRR project" (No - all-in IRR is 4-5%)
- "The field generates 37% returns" (No - only for new partners)
- "This proves deepwater oil is highly profitable" (No - original partners lost 100%)

---

## Bottom Line: Context is Everything

**Same Field, Same Oil, Three Different Realities:**

1. **New Partners:** 🎉 Brilliant investment, 37% IRR, private equity case study
2. **All-In Project:** 😐 Marginal economics, 4-5% IRR, below hurdle rate
3. **Original Partners:** 💀 Total loss, -100% IRR, governance failure

**The 37% IRR is real, but it exists because $3.5B was destroyed first.**

This is not fraud or misrepresentation—it's the reality of cyclical assets, distressed investing, and the critical importance of entry timing in capital-intensive industries.
