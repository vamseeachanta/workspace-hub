|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Capital Invested** | ~$883M | ~$361M | ~$360M | ~$197M |
| **Gross Revenue (211 MMBOE @ $70)** | $7.23B | $2.96B | $2.95B | $1.62B |
| **Operating Costs (211 MMBOE @ $15)** | $1.55B | $0.63B | $0.63B | $0.35B |

| **Net Profit** | $4.80B | $1.97B | $1.96B | $1.07B |
| **IRR (estimated)** | 37% | 37% | 37% | 37% |

**Notes:**
- IRR estimate from Hart Energy analyst report at FID
- Assumes all reserves produced at plateau rate
- Does not account for taxes, royalties, or time value beyond IRR
- Phase 2 expansion (110 MMBOE) would add ~52% to all metrics

### Comparison to Original Partners

| Metric | Original Partners (2009-2017) | Current Partners (2018-2025) |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Capital Invested** | >$3.2 billion | ~$2.4 billion |
| **Reserves Booked** | 0 (written off) | 211 MMBOE (2P) |
| **Return on Investment** | -100% | Projected 540% (6.4x) |
| **Key Difference** | Commodity price collapse + aggressive reserves | Lower cost basis + conservative development |

- Assumed operatorship and technical risk

### 4. Deepwater Development Lessons
- Paleogene reservoirs require conservative appraisal
- 20k psi technology now commercially viable
- Hub development model maximizes infrastructure value
- Timing entry at cycle bottom critical for returns

### 5. Disclosure & Governance Issues
- Multiple years between internal warnings and public disclosure
- Executive compensation disconnect from asset performance
- Reserve reporting challenged in lawsuits
- Whistleblower protection mechanisms tested
