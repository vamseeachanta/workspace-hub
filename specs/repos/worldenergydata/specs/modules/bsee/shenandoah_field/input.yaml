# ABOUTME: Shenandoah field economic analysis structured input
# ABOUTME: Captures objectives, tasks, sources, deliverables, and questions
objective: |
  Create a comprehensive economic brief for the Shenandoah field that captures
  true costs, partner exposures, historical write-offs, and current development
  economics.
tasks:
  - Summarize the complete timeline of Shenandoah ownership and capital events from discovery through first production, highlighting all partner changes.
  - Quantify every disclosed impairment, write-off, or suspended cost by partner (e.g., Anadarko, Cobalt, ConocoPhillips) with dates and SEC filings or earnings-call references.
  - Detail purchase considerations and valuations for all major transactions (Cobalt bankruptcy sale, LLOG/Beacon/Navitas deals, Beacon’s acquisition of LLOG’s stake, FID valuation).
  - Reconcile exploration and development spend with reported project valuations (field value vs. what each company carried on its books) to surface discrepancies.
  - Provide the latest development cost estimates (e.g., the reported $1.8 B CAPEX at FID), operating assumptions (start-up 2025, facility concept, drilling campaign), and break-even analysis if available.
  - Compile a partner matrix listing historical and current working-interest owners, operatorship status, and financial obligations/carry arrangements.
  - Note any public disputes, whistleblower claims (e.g., Lea Frye’s warnings), or regulatory filings that influenced valuation or impairments.
source_material:
  - Anadarko Petroleum 2017 impairment of approximately $467 million and the expensing of about $435 million in suspended exploratory costs (stock drop context).
  - Cobalt International Energy losses near $235 million and $232.8 million write-off tied to Shenandoah before its 2017 bankruptcy.
  - 2018 Cobalt bankruptcy auction: LLOG Exploration, Beacon Offshore, and Navitas Petroleum acquiring 70% working interest for $1.8 million; Anadarko and ConocoPhillips exit their 33% and 30% interests.
  - 2020 transaction: Beacon Offshore (via Blackstone) acquiring LLOG’s 31% stake for an implied $250 million valuation and assuming operatorship.
  - 2021 final investment decision for roughly $1.8 billion development; production start targeted for 2025.
deliverables:
  - Executive summary highlighting economic inflection points and total capital invested versus recovered.
  - Detailed tables covering impairments, write-offs, and transaction valuations by stakeholder.
  - Partner timeline diagram or narrative mapping ownership percentages over time.
  - Current outlook section describing project economics, cost structure, and remaining uncertainties.
constraints_expectations:
  - Cite all publicly available sources such as SEC filings, bankruptcy documents, press releases, investor presentations, and reputable news outlets.
  - Distinguish clearly between confirmed figures and estimates or industry commentary.
  - Emphasize discrepancies between field-level economics and individual company accounting treatments.
  - Include all known partners and financial participants across the project lifecycle.
open_questions:
  - Are there updated CAPEX or OPEX estimates released after the 2021 FID?
  - Did any partners secure insurance recoveries or tax benefits tied to the impairments?
  - What are current production targets compared with the original discovery expectations?
