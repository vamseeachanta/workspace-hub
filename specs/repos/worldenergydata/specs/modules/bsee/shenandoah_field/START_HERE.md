## 📖 What This Analysis Covers

### Central Question
**Does distressed asset recycling create value for society and the O&G industry, or does it simply transfer wealth between investor classes?**

### Key Finding
The Shenandoah field demonstrates **value transfer, not value creation** at the societal level:

- **New Partners:** 37% IRR (individual success)
- **All-In Project:** 4-5% IRR (societal underperformance)
- **Original Partners:** -100% IRR (total loss)

**Same reservoir, three different outcomes.**

**The paradox:** Private equity success coexists with societal inefficiency.
