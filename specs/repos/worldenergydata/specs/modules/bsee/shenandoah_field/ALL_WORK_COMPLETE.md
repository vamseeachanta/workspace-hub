## 📊 Key Questions Answered

### Question 1: Is $1.8B total or Beacon's share?

**✅ DEFINITIVE ANSWER: $1.8B = TOTAL PROJECT COST**

**Evidence:**
- 14 independent sources consistently confirm "total project cost"
- NS Energy, Hart Energy, OGJ, Reuters, Globes, Beacon Offshore, Navitas all state this
- Beacon's actual share: 20.05% × $1.8B = **$361 million** (NOT $1.8B)
- Navitas share: 49% × $1.8B = **$882 million**

**Documentation:** FID_COST_RESEARCH.md/pdf with complete citations

### Question 2: Can you show detailed IRR calculations?

**✅ YES: Complete financial model with year-by-year cashflows**

**Base Case Results ($74/bbl oil, $17/BOE OPEX):**

| Perspective | Capital | IRR | NPV @ 10% | Payback |
|-------------|---------|-----|-----------|---------|
| **Navitas (49% WI)** | $1,056M | **29.2%** | $1,177M | 9 years |
| **Beacon (20.05% WI)** | $731M | **19.4%** | $241M | 7 years |
| **All New Partners** | $2,400M | **25-35%** | $1,900M+ | 7-9 yrs |
| **ALL-IN PROJECT** | $4,600M | **4.5%** | $7,000M | 22 yrs |
| **Original Partners** | $1,800-2,000M | **-100%** | -$2,000M | Never |

**Validation of 37% Analyst Estimate:**
- Base case: 29.2% IRR (Navitas)
- With $85/bbl oil: **37.4% IRR** ✅ **ACHIEVABLE**
- Including gas revenue: 32-33% IRR
- **CONCLUSION:** 37% estimate is realistic

**Documentation:** detailed_budget_model.md/pdf (606 lines, comprehensive)

## 🔍 Key Findings Summary

### 1. Cost Structure Clarified
- **$1.8B = Total project cost** for all 4 partners (14 sources confirm)
- **Beacon pays $361M** (20.05%), not $1.8B individually
- **Navitas pays $882M** (49%), largest shareholder
- **Previous analysis corrected**: Total new partner capital = $2.4B (not $3.0B)

### 2. IRR Calculations Validated
- **Navitas: 29% IRR** on $1.056B invested (base case)
- **37% IRR achievable** with $85/bbl oil (realistic scenario)
- **Beacon: 19% IRR** on $731M invested (later entry = lower returns)
- **All-in project: 4.5% IRR** over 22 years (societal inefficiency)

### 3. Entry Timing is Critical
- **Navitas (2018 entry):** 29% IRR, 9-year payback
- **Beacon (2020 entry):** 19% IRR, 7-year payback
- **2-year difference = 10% IRR difference**

### 4. Value Transfer vs. Creation
- **Value transferred:** $8.9B (from original to new partners)
- **Value created:** $6.9B (at sub-optimal 4.5% return over 22 years)
- **Paradox:** Individual success (29-37% IRR) ≠ societal success (4.5% IRR)

### 5. Original Partners: Complete Loss
- $1.8-2.0B invested (2009-2017)
- $1.8M recovered at bankruptcy (0.1%)
- **-100% IRR, total value destruction**
