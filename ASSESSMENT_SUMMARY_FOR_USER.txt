================================================================================

STEP 1: REVIEW DOCUMENTATION (60 minutes total)

  a) Read PHASE_1C_ASSESSMENT_SUMMARY.md (10 min)
     └─ Get overview of assessment results

  b) Review PHASE_1_PILOT_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md (15 min)
     └─ Understand pilot deployment approach

  c) Check docs/TIER2_ASSESSMENT_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md (20 min)
     └─ Review comprehensive deployment plan

  d) Quick reference docs/TIER2_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (5 min)
     └─ See priority rankings and key findings

  □ Assessment approach is acceptable
  □ Pilot repository selections (pyproject-starter, ai-native-traditional-eng)
  □ Deployment timeline (~30 days for complete rollout)
  □ Configuration templates are appropriate
  □ Ready to proceed with Phase 1 Pilot deployment

================================================================================
                        CRITICAL NOTES
================================================================================

✅ ASSESSMENT ONLY: This is Phase 1C assessment only. NO CODE has been
   modified in any repository. NO configuration files have been deployed.
   Everything is prepared but awaiting user approval.

✅ ZERO MODIFICATIONS: All 12 repositories remain unchanged. Only
   documentation has been created.

✅ TEMPLATES PREPARED: All configuration templates are ready in
   PHASE_1_PILOT_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md, ready to deploy on approval.

✅ REVERSIBLE: Phase 1 deployment is designed to be reversible if needed.
   Rollback procedures are documented.

================================================================================
                        RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

PROCEED WITH PHASE 1 PILOT DEPLOYMENT

Recommendation: Deploy standardized testing framework to the 2 pilot
repositories (pyproject-starter and ai-native-traditional-eng) as planned.

Rationale:
  • Both repositories have HIGH readiness (85-90%)
  • LOW risk (smallest repos, existing test infrastructure)
  • Will establish patterns for remaining 10 repositories
  • Learnings will improve Phase 2+ efficiency
  • Reversible if issues encountered

Expected Success Rate: HIGH (95%+)
