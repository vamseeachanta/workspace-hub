- No uncommitted changes
- Ready for development

## 📊 Final Statistics

### Complete Trunk State Achieved
- **25/25 repositories** (100%) now follow trunk-based development
- **All repos** use standard branch names (main or master)
- **Zero** stale branches remaining
- **Zero** uncommitted changes or stashes

### Repository Distribution
- Using `main`: 15 repositories (60%)
- Using `master`: 10 repositories (40%)

## 🏆 Achievement Unlocked

Your entire GitHub workspace now has:
- ✅ **100% trunk-based development compliance**
- ✅ **Consistent branch naming** (main/master only)
- ✅ **Zero technical debt** from old branches
- ✅ **Clean working directories** across all repos
- ✅ **Simplified git workflow** for all projects

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Maintain Clean State
```bash
# Regular maintenance command
/git-trunk-flow

# Check all repos status
./check_trunk_status.sh
```

### 2. Development Best Practices
- Commit directly to trunk for small changes
- Use feature flags for incomplete features
- Keep commits atomic and well-described
- Run tests before pushing

### 3. Standardization (Optional)
Consider migrating all repos to use `main` consistently:
```bash
# For repos still using master
gh repo edit --default-branch main
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main
```
