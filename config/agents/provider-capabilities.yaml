# WRK-235 Strategy Decision (2026-02-24): Maintain all three providers (Option A)
# - Claude: orchestrator + primary executor
# - Codex: cross-review hard gate (independent second opinion, budget cost tier)
# - Gemini: research + large-doc processing (1M context window advantage)
# Review trigger: if Claude reaches 1M context OR Codex cross-review quality drops
# below Claude Sonnet level, consolidate. Evidence from WRK-237 cost tracking.
# Next reassessment: 2026-06-06 (June first-Friday review)
