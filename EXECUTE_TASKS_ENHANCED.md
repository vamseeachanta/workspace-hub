## 🧠 Intelligent Task Classification

### Automatically Parallelizable Tasks
Tasks containing these keywords run in parallel:
- `test`, `verify`, `check`, `validate`
- `analyze`, `scan`, `lint`, `format`
- `compile`, `build`, `generate`, `create`
- `fetch`, `download`, `process`, `convert`
- `optimize`

### Sequential-Only Tasks
Tasks requiring sequential execution:
- `deploy`, `migrate`, `update database`
- `push`, `release`, `merge`, `rebase`
- `install`, `configure`, `setup`

## 📈 Time Estimation Algorithm

### Calculation Method
1. **Classify tasks** as parallel or sequential
2. **Distribute parallel tasks** across available workers
3. **Calculate parallel completion** time (longest worker)
4. **Add sequential task** times
5. **Apply 10% overhead** for context switching
6. **Generate human-readable** estimate

### Example Calculation
```
Parallel Tasks: 50 minutes total
Workers: 10
Parallel Time: 50/10 = 5 minutes (ideal)
Sequential Tasks: 20 minutes
Overhead: 10%
Total: (5 + 20) * 1.1 = 27.5 minutes
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Command-Line Arguments
| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--workers` | 10 | Number of parallel workers |
| `--estimate-only` | False | Show time estimate without executing |
| `--sequential` | False | Force sequential execution |
| `--update-file` | False | Update tasks.md with completion status |
| `--verbose` | False | Show detailed execution logs |

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set default worker count
export EXECUTE_TASKS_WORKERS=20

# Enable verbose logging
export EXECUTE_TASKS_VERBOSE=1

# Auto-update task files
export EXECUTE_TASKS_AUTO_UPDATE=1
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. **Accurate Time Estimates**
Always include time estimates in your tasks:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Complex task `[2h]`
- [ ] 2. Simple task `[5m]`
```

### 2. **Task Granularity**
Break large tasks into subtasks for better parallelization:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Test suite `[30m]`
  - [ ] Unit tests `[10m]`
  - [ ] Integration tests `[10m]`
  - [ ] E2E tests `[10m]`
```

### 3. **Dependency Management**
Mark sequential dependencies clearly:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Build application `[15m]`
- [ ] 2. Deploy to staging `[30m]` # Requires task 1
```

## 💡 User Time Management

### Automatic Recommendations
Based on estimated completion time:

| Duration | Recommendation | Example Message |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| < 30 min | Wait | "✅ Tasks will complete quickly - you can wait" |
| 30-120 min | Coffee break | "☕ Good time for a coffee break" |
| 2-8 hours | Meal break | "🍽️ Consider taking a meal break" |
| > 8 hours | Overnight | "📆 Consider scheduling for overnight execution" |

### Progress Monitoring
Real-time progress bar with:
- Percentage complete
- Tasks completed/total
- Currently running tasks
- Estimated time remaining

## 🔍 Test Verification Features

### Automatic Checks
1. **Parallel test capability** - Verifies pytest-xdist installation
2. **Test discovery** - Ensures tests are found
3. **Execution verification** - Confirms tests run successfully
4. **Performance measurement** - Reports time savings

### Sample Verification Output
```
✅ Tests configured for parallel execution
✅ Using 10 parallel workers
Performance gain: 75% time savings

```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Falls back to sequential execution if parallel fails
- Continues with remaining tasks on individual failures
- Provides detailed error reports
- Suggests fixes for common issues

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Tests not parallel | Install `pytest-xdist`: `pip install pytest-xdist` |
| Task timeout | Increase timeout or split into smaller tasks |
| Memory issues | Reduce worker count with `--workers 5` |
| Dependencies | Ensure sequential tasks marked appropriately |
