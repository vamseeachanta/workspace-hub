- `teamresumes`: 202412, 202501

## 🏗️ Trunk-Based Development Benefits

### Now Achieved:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each repo has one main branch
2. **Simplified Workflow**: No complex branching strategies
3. **Faster Integration**: Direct commits to trunk
4. **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: No long-lived feature branches
5. **Consistent State**: All repos follow same pattern

## 📋 Special Notes

### achantas-media
- Uses `jun-jul-aug` as its primary branch
- This is intentional and should be maintained

### digitalmodel
- Has stashed changes from our create-spec updates
- Use `git stash pop` to restore when needed

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Recommended Practices:
1. **Commit directly to trunk** for small changes
2. **Use feature flags** for incomplete features
3. **Keep commits small and frequent**
4. **Run tests before pushing**
5. **Use `/git-trunk-flow` for automated workflow

### Maintenance Commands:
```bash
# Check status of all repos
./check_trunk_status.sh

# Sync all repos
/git-sync-all-enhanced

# Use trunk flow
/git-trunk-flow
```

## 📈 Summary Statistics

- **Total Repositories**: 25
- **Clean Trunk State**: 24 (96%)
- **Special Cases**: 1 (4%)
- **Branches Deleted**: 13
- **Time Saved**: Estimated 2-3 hours of manual work

## ✨ Conclusion

Your repository ecosystem is now:
- ✅ Following trunk-based development
- ✅ Clean and organized
- ✅ Ready for efficient development
- ✅ Consistent across all projects

All repositories are properly configured for trunk-based development, ensuring a streamlined and consistent workflow across your entire codebase ecosystem!
