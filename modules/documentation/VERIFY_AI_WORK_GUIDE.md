## 💡 Best Practices

### For Task Creation

1. **Use Simple Language**
   ```json
   {
     "description": "Click the big blue button"  // Good ✅
     "description": "Initiate authentication"    // Too complex ❌
   }
   ```

2. **Break Into Small Steps**
   ```json
   "instructions": [
     "Open your browser",      // Good - one action ✅
     "Go to www.example.com",   // Good - clear ✅
     "Click Login"              // Good - specific ✅
   ]
   ```

3. **Clear Expected Outcomes**
   ```json
   "expected_outcome": "You should see a welcome message" // Clear ✅
   "expected_outcome": "System responds appropriately"    // Vague ❌
   ```

### For Users

1. **Take Your Time** - No rush! Read each step carefully
2. **Ask for Help** - Use the 'help' option when confused
3. **Be Specific** - Describe exactly what you see
4. **Try Again** - It's okay to retry steps multiple times

### For AI Agents

1. **Listen to Feedback** - User knows what they're seeing
2. **Simplify Solutions** - Make fixes easy to understand
3. **Provide Examples** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Be Encouraging** - Positive reinforcement helps!

## 📊 Session Reports

After each session, a detailed JSON report is saved to the `verification_report/` subdirectory within the spec folder:

**Location**: `<spec-folder>/verification_report/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

```json
{
  "session_id": "20240115_143022",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:35:27",
  "total_steps": 5,
  "completed": 4,
  "total_time": 245.3,
  "steps": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "title": "Check Website Loading",
      "status": "✅ Completed",
      "attempts": 1,
      "time_spent": 45.2,
      "user_feedback": "",
      "ai_response": ""
    }
  ],
  "feedback_log": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:33:15",
      "step": 2,
      "feedback": "Images not loading",
      "attempt": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. **QA Testing**
Verify that features work as expected with non-technical testers

### 2. **User Acceptance Testing**
Get feedback from actual users in a structured way

### 3. **Educational Tool**
Teach children about testing and quality assurance

### 4. **Documentation Verification**
Ensure documentation steps actually work

### 5. **Accessibility Testing**
Verify UI is usable by people of all abilities

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Custom Validation Functions
```python
def validate_color(element, expected_color):
    """Custom validation for color checking"""
    actual = element.get_attribute('color')
    return actual == expected_color
```

### Integration with Test Frameworks
```python
# Can integrate with pytest, unittest, etc.
import pytest

def test_with_verification(verifier):
    for step in verifier.steps:
        result = run_test(step)
        verifier.record_result(result)
```

### Automated Screenshot Capture
```python
# Optional: Capture screenshots at each step
from PIL import ImageGrab

def capture_step_screenshot(step_number):
    screenshot = ImageGrab.grab()
    screenshot.save(f"step_{step_number}.png")
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Command won't run | Navigate to a spec folder first (must contain spec.md) |
| "Not in spec folder" error | Use `cd .agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature/` |
| GUI won't open | Install tkinter or use `--cli` mode |
| Tasks not loading | Check JSON format is valid |
| Can't type feedback | Make sure to click in the text box |
| Steps too fast | Take your time - no time limit! |
| Confused by instructions | Use 'help' option for more details |
| Reports not found | Check `./verification_report/` subdirectory |
