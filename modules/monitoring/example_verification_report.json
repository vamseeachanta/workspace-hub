Update all gallery image src attributes to use correct path\n2. Add fallback images for missing assets\n3. Implement lazy loading to improve performance\n4. Add onerror handlers to gracefully handle missing images\n\nCode changes needed:\n- Update image paths in gallery.html\n- Add fallback.jpg to assets folder\n- Implement error handling in gallery.js\n\nWould you like me to make these changes?",

Add search result container to HTML\n2. Implement search handler in backend/JS\n3. Connect search query to data source\n4. Display results or 'no results' message\n\nQuick Fix for Testing:\n- Add preventDefault to form submission\n- Implement client-side search simulation\n- Display mock results for demonstration\n\nThis requires backend implementation to fully work.",
