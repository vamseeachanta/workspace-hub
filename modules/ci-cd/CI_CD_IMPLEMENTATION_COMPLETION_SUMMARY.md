- Multi-language project support

### 4. Standardization
- Consistent workflow structure
- Modern GitHub Actions usage
- UV package manager adoption
- Unified release processes

## Files Created

### Per Repository (14 repositories × 4 workflows = 56 files):
```
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml                    # Main CI/CD pipeline
├── release.yml              # Release automation
├── dependency-update.yml    # Weekly dependency updates
└── codeql-analysis.yml     # Security analysis
```

### Special Configurations:
- **investments/ci.yml**: Custom data validation workflows
- **client_projects/ci.yml**: Multi-language support workflows
- **investments/release.yml**: Financial analysis release notes
- **client_projects/release.yml**: Client project release notes

## Next Steps

### 1. Repository Initialization
Enable GitHub Actions in each repository by:
- Pushing changes to trigger first workflow runs
- Configuring branch protection rules
- Setting up required status checks

### 2. Security Configuration
- Configure CODECOV_TOKEN for coverage reporting
- Set up PyPI publishing tokens for package repositories
- Configure dependabot security updates

### 3. Monitoring
- Monitor workflow execution across all repositories
- Review and optimize workflow performance
- Address any repository-specific configuration needs

### 4. Team Enablement
- Train team on new CI/CD processes
- Document workflow customization procedures
- Establish workflow maintenance procedures
