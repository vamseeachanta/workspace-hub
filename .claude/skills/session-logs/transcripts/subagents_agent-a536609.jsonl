Here is a summary of what was modified in `D:\\workspace-hub\\digitalmodel\\src\\digitalmodel\\solvers\\orcaflex\\modular_generator\\builders\\lines_builder.py`:\n\n**Change 1 -- Activated the winch wire call in `build()` (lines 53-61)**\n\nThe dead `pass` block was replaced with actual logic that:\n- Computes `total_length` by summing all pipeline segment lengths\n- Calls `_build_winch_wire_line()` with the end buoy name and total pipeline length\n- Appends the resulting winch wire line dict to `lines_list`\n- Registers `\"Winch wire\"` under `additional_line_names` for cross-builder reference (consumed by GroupsBuilder)\n\n**Change 2 -- Rewrote `_build_winch_wire_line()` method (lines 271-326)**\n\nThe old method had the wrong signature (`tug_index`, `tug_position`, `pipeline_name`) and wrong connection logic (connected tugs to pipeline). The new method:\n- Takes `end_buoy_name` and `pipeline_length` as parameters\n- Connects End A to the 6D buoy (the vessel-end buoy) and End B to a fixed point positioned at `pipeline_length + 60` meters\n- Includes the 9-column connection header with `ConnectionzRelativeTo`\n- Sets connection bending stiffness to zero (flexible wire)\n- Uses a single 165m segment with 5m mesh target and `Winch wire_LT` line type\n- Adds `StaticsStep1: \"User specified\"`, `ContentsMethod: \"Uniform\"`, and `ContentsDensity: 0`\n- Matches the working 30in reference pattern for floating installation statics convergence\n\nNo other methods, imports, or file sections were changed.","session":"93d124a4-5d07-4ab3-aa8e-80a97dc6a468"}
