Here is what I did:\n\n**Problem**: The `test-automation` entry point on line 198 of `D:\\workspace-hub\\digitalmodel\\pyproject.toml` referenced `test_automation.__main__:main`. That module only exists under `tests/test_automation/__main__.py`, but `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` (lines 216-219) is configured to only include packages from `src/` matching `digitalmodel*` and explicitly excludes `tests*`. This means the entry point would fail at runtime in any installed/distributed build.\n\n**Decision**: Since `test_automation` is test tooling (it lives in `tests/`, not `src/digitalmodel/`), it does not belong as a console script in the distributed package. Removed the line.\n\n**Verification**: After removal, 17 entry points remain, all correctly referencing modules under `digitalmodel.*`. The package rebuilt and installed successfully with no errors.","session":"ee4761ec-03a1-4eaf-9585-1f552e410733"}
