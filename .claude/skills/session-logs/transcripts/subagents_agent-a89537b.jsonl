Let me compile the full summary.\n\nHere is the complete test suite summary:\n\n---\n\n## Test Suite Summary\n\n### Batch Results\n\n| # | Batch | Passed | Failed | Errors | Skipped | Total | Time |\n|---|-------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|------|\n| 1 | `tests/compat/` + `test_restructure_compat.py` | 75 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 75 | 1.9s |\n| 2 | `tests/hydrodynamics/` | 646 | 16 | 0 | 2 | 664 | 53.0s |\n| 3 | `tests/infrastructure/` | 328 | 24 | 28 | 4 | 384 | 123.1s |\n| 4 | `tests/marine_ops/` | 675 | 81 | 0 | 5 | 761 | 300.8s |\n| 5 | `tests/specialized/` | 530 | 23 | 0 | 38 | 591 | 11.4s |\n| 6 | `tests/structural/` | 189 | 26 | 0 | 1 | 216 | 59.8s |\n| 7 | `tests/subsea/` | 123 | 8 | 20 | 0 | 151 | 52.1s |\n| 8 | `tests/signal_processing/` | 13 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 2.1s |\n| 9 | `tests/solvers/` (aggregated sub-batches) | 392 | 20 | 37 | 3 | 452 | ~122s |\n| 10 | `tests/data_systems/` | 61 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 61 | 2.0s |\n| 11 | `tests/visualization/` + `test_agent_dashboard.py` | 16 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 18 | 1.3s |\n| 12 | `tests/workflows/` (aggregated sub-batches) | 313 | 29 | 49 | 1 | 392 | ~183s |\n| | **TOTALS** | **3,361** | **229** | **134** | **54** | **3,778** | ~15min |\n\n### Overall Rate: 89.0% passing (3,361 / 3,778)\n\n**Note:** 2 test files hang indefinitely and could not complete:\n- `tests/solvers/orcaflex/test_load_orcaflex_files.py` (likely OrcaFlex API dependency)\n- `tests/workflows/integration/test_metocean_streaming.py` (likely network/streaming dependency)\n\n---\n\n### IMPORT-Related Failures (ImportError / ModuleNotFoundError)\n\nThese are broken imports that indicate missing classes/functions or structural issues:\n\n| Location | Error | Count |\n|----------|-------|-------|\n| `tests/infrastructure/core/test_cache.py` | `ImportError: cannot import name 'Cache' from 'digitalmodel.infrastructure.core.cache'` | 28 errors |\n| `tests/workflows/automation/test_agent_selector.py` | `ImportError` (collection errors for `IntelligentAgentSelector`) | 24 errors |\n| `tests/workflows/integration/test_cross_module_integration.py` | Collection errors (import/setup failures) | 10 errors |\n| `tests/marine_ops/.../test_documentation_examples.py` | `ImportError: cannot import name 'ShipConfiguration'`, `'export_to_json'`, `'plot_force_distribution'`, `'sectional_area_curve'` | 4 failures |\n\n**Total import-related: ~66 errors/failures** across 4 test files.\n\n---\n\n### Non-Import Failures (Pre-Existing / Numerical / Missing Deps)\n\n| Category | Examples | Approx Count |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| **Numerical/assertion** | Wave spectra stats, interpolation, catenary, pipe sizing, stress-strain, rainflow, buckling, passing ship formulations | ~80 |\n| **Missing external deps** | Blender not found (37 errors), gmsh failures (10), AQWA CLI path not found (7) | ~54 |\n| **TypeError in fixtures** | `FluidProperties.__init__()` got unexpected keyword `'name'` (subsea VIV tests) | 20 |\n| **YAML parsing** | OrcaFlex format converter: `expected a single document in the stream` | 3 |\n| **File not found** | Mooring tension iteration scripts, AQWA CLI path | 6 |\n| **Performance/benchmark** | Cache benchmark fixture reuse, integration performance | 13 |\n| **Dashboard date range** | `ValueError: No data in selected date range` | 2 |\n| **Database/Redis** | Connection pooling, HA failover, MongoDB integration | 14 |\n| **Integration logic** | Multi-module interaction, legacy compat, template validation | ~25 |\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **89% of tests pass** (3,361 out of 3,778 collected).\n2. **No new import breakages from uncommitted changes** -- the import errors all come from pre-existing structural issues (`Cache` class missing from cache module, `IntelligentAgentSelector` setup errors, passing ship missing exports).\n3. **Largest failure clusters** are in `tests/marine_ops/` (81 failures, mostly numerical/formula issues in passing ship + catenary performance) and `tests/workflows/` (29 failures + 49 errors, mostly integration/performance tests needing external services).\n4. **External dependency errors** (Blender, gmsh, Redis, AQWA CLI, OrcaFlex API) account for roughly 60+ errors/failures and are expected on a Windows dev machine without those tools installed.\n5. **Two test files hang** due to blocking I/O (OrcaFlex file loading, metocean streaming) and should be marked with a timeout or skip marker.","session":"ee4761ec-03a1-4eaf-9585-1f552e410733"}
