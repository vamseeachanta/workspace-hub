Includes compat shim with `MetaPathFinder`, deprecation warnings, 45 compat tests, test/example/doc stubs for uncovered modules, and CI workflow path fixes.

The massive restructure (2,567 files) is already committed in `c187d3ed`. The only uncommitted changes are 6 files (4 regenerated PNG charts, 1 JSON summary, and minor text diffs) in the marine engineering performance test charts directory.
