Here's the summary:\n\n## WRK-066 Execution Summary\n\n### Phase 1: Eliminate Duplication\n- **Catenary**: 4 → 2 modules. Deleted `marine_engineering/catenary/` (carbon copy) and `subsea/catenary/` (legacy, unique code preserved in `catenary_riser/legacy/`)\n- **Wave spectra**: 3 → 1 module. Deleted both `marine_ops/*/wave_spectra/` copies, kept `hydrodynamics/wave_spectra.py` as canonical. Fixed 10 files with broken OOP imports.\n\n### Phase 2: Root Cleanup & Naming\n- Moved `diffraction_cli.py` → `hydrodynamics/diffraction/`\n- Moved `standards_lookup.py` → `infrastructure/common/`\n- Deleted `engine.py.backup`\n- Deleted `structural/analysis/` (stubs)\n- Renamed `fatigue_analysis/` → `fatigue_apps/`\n\n### Phase 3: OrcaFlex Consolidation\n- Merged `orcaflex_post_process/` → `orcaflex/post_process/`\n- Merged `orcaflex_browser/` → `orcaflex/browser/`\n- Renamed `OrcaFlex_Post/` → `post_results/` (fixed casing)\n\n### Phase 4: Discoverability\n- Added `__all__` with 11 domain groups to `__init__.py`\n- Added module docstring listing all domain groups\n\n### Verification\n- 9 tests pass (all skip due to missing optional deps — expected)\n- All 11 domain groups import cleanly\n- Backward compat via `_compat.py` updated for all moves\n\nChanges are staged but **not committed**. Would you like me to commit these?","session":"b618987d-2c3c-4fc5-8dfe-a055166114a8"}
