Here is a summary of all uncommitted changes.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Uncommitted Changes\n\n### Total Changed Files: 10\n\n### Breakdown by Status\n\n| Status | Count | Description |\n|--------|-------|-------------|\n| `M` (modified, unstaged) | 6 | Modified working tree files |\n| `??` (untracked) | 4 | New files not yet tracked by git |\n\n**No staged modifications** (nothing in the index ready to commit).\n**No deleted files** in the current working tree.\n\n---\n\n### Modified Files (6 unstaged)\n\nAll 6 modified files are under `tests/marine_ops/marine_engineering/integration/charts/performance/`:\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| `memory_efficiency.png` | Binary: 109,249 -> 98,497 bytes |\n| `parallel_potential.png` | Binary: 122,272 -> 107,395 bytes |\n| `performance_summary.json` | 14 lines changed (7 insertions, 7 deletions) |\n| `scalability.png` | Binary: 159,751 -> 168,062 bytes |\n| `wave_spectrum_performance.png` | Binary: 168,330 -> 194,871 bytes |\n| `workflow_performance.png` | Binary: 187,394 -> 193,287 bytes |\n\nThese are regenerated performance benchmark charts and their JSON summary -- likely from a re-run of integration tests.\n\n---\n\n### Untracked Files (4 new)\n\n| File/Directory | Description |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| `specs/modules/orcaflex/pipeline-installation-modular/` | New spec directory for pipeline installation module |\n| `specs/modules/parallel-nibbling-aho.md` | New spec file (auto-generated name) |\n| `src/digitalmodel/hydrodynamics/diffraction/aqwa_runner.py` | New AQWA runner implementation |\n| `tests/hydrodynamics/diffraction/test_aqwa_runner.py` | New test file for AQWA runner |\n\n---\n\n### Test Results\n\n- **9 tests collected and skipped**, 0 failures, 0 errors\n- Tests pass (exit clean) but all 9 discovered tests were **skipped** (likely due to missing optional dependencies like OrcFxAPI on this machine)\n- There is a minor pytest capture teardown `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file` which is a known pytest bug on Windows and does not affect results\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **The working tree is relatively clean** compared to the initial `git status` snapshot you provided at the start of this conversation. That initial snapshot showed ~280+ changed files (massive restructuring, legacy deletions, module moves). It appears those changes have already been committed (the most recent commit `c187d3ed` was `refactor(WRK-066): restructure into 11 domain groups with 3-layer compat`).\n\n2. **Current uncommitted work** is small and falls into two categories:\n   - **Regenerated test artifacts** (5 PNGs + 1 JSON) -- performance benchmark charts that were re-rendered\n   - **New AQWA runner feature** (`aqwa_runner.py` + its test + 2 spec files) -- new functionality being developed\n\n3. **No staged changes** exist -- nothing is queued for commit yet.\n\n4. **No tests are failing** -- the 9 discovered tests skip cleanly (likely gated by `pytest.importorskip(\"OrcFxAPI\")` or similar).","session":"b618987d-2c3c-4fc5-8dfe-a055166114a8"}
