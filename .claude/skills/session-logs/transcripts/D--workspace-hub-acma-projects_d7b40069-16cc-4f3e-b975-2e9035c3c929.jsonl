{"ts":"2026-02-03T02:54:46.799Z","role":"ai","text":"Here is my review of the B1912 proposal data, organized by what's established, what's been clarified, and what remains open or needs attention.\n\n---\n\n## B1912 - HWCG Vessel Analysis: Proposal Data & Assumptions Review\n\n### Project Summary\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|------|--------|\n| Client | HWCG LLC (Steve Scanio, Technical Director) |\n| RFP No. | 2026-001, Rev.2 |\n| Subject | Vessel Analysis - Hang-off loads on vessel deck & gunwale/sideshell |\n| Proposal Due | **16-Feb-2026, noon CT** |\n| Work Delivery | **10-Apr-2026** (or propose alternate) |\n| Award Target | 2-Mar-2026 |\n| Commercial | Lump sum preferred; Net 30 payment |\n\n---\n\n### Scope of Work (from RFP)\n\n1. Estimate deck bearing load and pressure\n2. Determine tie-down requirements (weldment size, length, tie-down plan)\n3. Evaluate deck loads from hang-off porches on MPSV/LCV deck and underdeck structure\n4. Develop FEA model of vessel structure; analyze deck and gunwale/sideshell impacted by porches\n5. Prepare technical memo/report naming the vessel used\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Schedule for performing SOW\n- Engineering report/memo with GA drawings and storyboard pictures\n- Org chart, schedule, lump sum cost + hourly rates for change orders\n\n---\n\n### Clarifications Obtained (from email chain)\n\nThese items were raised by Scott (26-Jan) and answered by Steve Scanio (28-Jan):\n\n| Question | HWCG Response |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Are the 40k/200k lb loads the design loads, or must ACMA derive hydrodynamic hang-off loads? | The 40,000 lb and 200,000 lb are the stated loads **without dynamic amplification factors**. The porch analysis itself did include factors. Hydrodynamic force derivation should be **priced into the quote** for discussion post-award. |\n| Will hang-off load attitude (vertical/transverse/longitudinal angles) be defined by HWCG? | **Depends on the vessel ultimately chosen** - to be discussed further. Should be included in the quote. |\n| Can ACMA use a representative vessel from its own data? | Yes - HWCG is OK with ACMA providing a representative vessel, **provided HWCG reviews and confirms acceptability** with the installation company. |\n\n---\n\n### Open Items & Assumptions to Confirm with Team\n\nThese are the issues I see that need resolution before finalizing the proposal:\n\n**1. Dynamic Amplification / Hydrodynamic Analysis Scope**\n\nScott's follow-up (28-Jan, 5:54 PM) raises a significant scope question that **did not receive a reply** in the email chain:\n\n- The 40k/200k lb loads have **no dynamic amplification factors** applied.\n- Scott points out that hydrodynamic drag on the hung-off object (from vessel heave, pitch, roll velocities) is non-trivial and would require either:\n  - Morrison-type elements in a combined 3D hydrodynamic ship/object model, or\n  - CFD-derived drag coefficients fed into a hydrodynamic model\n- Steve's earlier response says to \"price this into your quote\" and \"discuss post-award.\"\n\n**Assumption needed**: The proposal should include a hydrodynamic vessel motions analysis as a line item. Decide whether to:\n  - (a) Include it as a priced task within the base scope, or\n  - (b) Present it as an optional/additional scope item with separate pricing\n\n**2. Load Case Design Criteria**\n\nScott asked: \"I presume the design criteria will be different between the 40,000 lb load and the 200,000 lb load?\" - **No response recorded.**\n\n**Assumption needed**: The proposal should define:\n  - Normal operating case: 40,000 lb per porch (pennant rigging) - all 3 porches loaded simultaneously\n  - Non-planned/emergency case: 200,000 lb on a **single** porch (capping stack + rigging)\n  - Appropriate load factors/safety factors for each case (different acceptance criteria likely warranted)\n\n**3. Environmental Conditions**\n\nThe RFP states:\n  - 1-year winter storm\n  - 2-knot current\n\n**Assumption needed**: ACMA will need to define the metocean data (Hs, Tp, wind speed, current profile) consistent with a 1-year winter storm in the Gulf of America. Confirm whether HWCG will supply this or if ACMA should use standard GOM data (e.g., API RP 2MET or similar).\n\n**4. Vessel Selection**\n\nHWCG agreed ACMA can propose a representative MPSV/LCV, subject to HWCG + installation company approval.\n\n**Assumption needed**: Which vessel will ACMA propose? The team needs to identify a candidate vessel for which structural drawings are available. The deck layout (Figure 1 in RFP) shows 3 porches along the vessel side with **12 ft of bulwarks needing removal** at each porch location.\n\n**5. Parties / Installation Company**\n\nVamsee's notes flag that the \"installation company\" is unclear. From the RFP and emails:\n  - **Client**: HWCG LLC\n  - **Technical Advisor**: Tor Gavem, Apex Subsea\n  - **Contractor**: ACMA (engineering analysis)\n  - **Installation Company**: Not named - this is the entity operating the MPSV/LCV. HWCG will confirm vessel acceptability **with** the installation company.\n\n**Assumption needed**: ACMA's scope is the engineering analysis only. ACMA does not need to identify or contract the installation company. Vessel approval is HWCG's responsibility.\n\n**6. Hang-off Porch Geometry**\n\nThe RFP states: \"Detailed STP or AutoCAD drawings will be provided of the hang-off porches post Contract award.\"\n\n**Assumption needed**: The proposal should note that final analysis depends on receipt of porch drawings. Preliminary work can begin with the RFP figures, but FEA model completion is contingent on receiving the detailed geometry.\n\n**7. Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nScott committed to including: \"a sensitivity analysis of the hang off structure and the ship's supporting structure to the variation of application of the loads in all three axes.\"\n\n**Assumption needed**: Confirm this is priced into the scope - it adds analysis runs beyond a single load direction.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Proposal Structure\n\nBased on the above, the work could be structured as:\n\n**Phase 1 - Vessel Selection & Load Definition**\n- Select representative MPSV/LCV, submit to HWCG for approval\n- Define metocean criteria for 1-yr winter storm, 2-knot current\n- Define load cases (normal 40k lb x3, non-planned 200k lb x1)\n- Apply conservative dynamic amplification factors (DAFs)\n\n**Phase 2 - Structural Analysis**\n- Deck bearing capacity assessment\n- Tie-down design (weldments, plan)\n- FEA model of vessel deck/underdeck structure and gunwale/sideshell\n- Analyze under all load cases with sensitivity to load direction (3-axis variation)\n\n**Phase 3 (Optional/Post-Award Discussion) - Hydrodynamic Analysis**\n- Vessel motion analysis (RAOs for heave, pitch, roll)\n- Dynamic load derivation at porch locations accounting for vessel motions\n- Refined DAFs replacing the conservative Phase 2 factors\n\n**Deliverable - Technical Report**\n- Results, vessel GA, storyboard, recommendations\n\n---\n\n### Items for Team Discussion\n\n1. **Which vessel to propose?** Need one with available structural drawings.\n2. **Dynamic analysis scope**: Include in base bid or as an option? Scott's emails suggest HWCG expects it priced in.\n3. **What DAFs to use** for the preliminary (Phase 2) structural assessment if the hydrodynamic analysis is deferred?\n4. **Staffing/org chart**: Who leads the FEA work, who handles the hydrodynamic analysis if included?\n5. **Schedule**: Can ACMA deliver by 10-Apr-2026 given a ~2-Mar award date (~5.5 weeks)?\n6. **TSA status**: Does ACMA have an existing Technical Service Agreement with HWCG, or does one need to be reviewed?","session":"d7b40069-16cc-4f3e-b975-2e9035c3c929"}
