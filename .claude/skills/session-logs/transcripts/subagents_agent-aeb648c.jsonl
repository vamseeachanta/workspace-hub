{"ts":"2026-02-03T19:42:40.327Z","role":"ai","text":"All six checks are complete. Here is the full report:\n\n---\n\n## Verification Results\n\n### Check 1: Deprecated flat imports in `src/` (excluding `_compat.py` and `modules/__init__.py`)\n**Result: PASS** -- No output. No deprecated flat imports of `from digitalmodel.diffraction` remain in source code.\n\n### Check 2: Remaining `digitalmodel.modules.` in examples\n**Result: PASS** -- No output. No references to `digitalmodel.modules.` found in examples.\n\n### Check 3: Remaining flat imports in examples (orcaflex, fatigue, stress)\n**Result: PASS** -- No matches found for any of the three patterns (`from digitalmodel.orcaflex`, `from digitalmodel.fatigue`, `from digitalmodel.stress`) in example files.\n\n### Check 4: Compat tests (`tests/test_restructure_compat.py`)\n**Result: PASS -- 30/30 tests passed** in 1.26s.\n\nAll test classes passed:\n- `TestCLIEntryPoints` (16 tests) -- all entry point modules exist\n- `TestCurrentImports` (9 tests) -- all key modules importable, top-level and subpackage imports work\n- `TestCompatModule` (3 tests) -- register, get_moved_modules, is_moved all work\n- `TestEngineImports` (1 test) -- engine module importable\n- Test file: `D:\\workspace-hub\\digitalmodel\\tests\\test_restructure_compat.py`\n\n### Check 5: Hydrodynamics tests (Phase A verification)\n**Result: FAIL -- 23 passed, 1 failed**\n\nThe failing test:\n- **Test**: `TestAQWALISParser::test_parse_all` in `D:\\workspace-hub\\digitalmodel\\tests\\hydrodynamics\\diffraction\\test_aqwa_parser.py` (line 153)\n- **Assertion**: `assert len(data['added_mass']) <= n_freqs` failed because `8 <= 7` is false\n- **Root cause**: The AQWA LIS parser extracted 7 frequencies from the frequency table but parsed 8 added mass matrices (and 8 damping matrices). The test asserts that the number of added mass entries should be at most the number of frequencies, but the parser is finding an extra matrix -- likely an infinite-frequency or zero-frequency added mass entry that is not counted in the frequency extraction step.\n\n### Check 6: Total changed files\n**Result: 83 files** reported by `git status --short`.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Check | Status | Details |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| 1. Deprecated flat imports in src/ | PASS | No violations found |\n| 2. `digitalmodel.modules.` in examples | PASS | No violations found |\n| 3. Flat imports in examples | PASS | No violations found |\n| 4. Compat tests | PASS | 30/30 passed |\n| 5. Hydrodynamics tests | FAIL | 23/24 passed; `test_parse_all` fails due to added_mass count (8) exceeding frequency count (7) |\n| 6. Changed files count | INFO | 83 files changed |\n\nThe only failure is in `test_parse_all` where the AQWA LIS parser finds 8 added mass/damping matrices but only 7 frequencies. This is likely a data/parser discrepancy where the parser picks up an additional frequency (e.g., zero or infinite frequency added mass) that is not listed in the frequency extraction section. Either the parser's `extract_frequencies_and_periods` method or the test assertion at line 153 of `D:\\workspace-hub\\digitalmodel\\tests\\hydrodynamics\\diffraction\\test_aqwa_parser.py` needs to be updated to account for this.","session":"ee4761ec-03a1-4eaf-9585-1f552e410733"}
