Here's a summary of what's included:\n\n**10 sections** covering the full scope of assumptions and clarifications:\n\n| Section | Key Content |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 1. Loads | 40k lb normal / 200k lb non-planned; static values without DAFs; ACMA to apply conservative DAFs |\n| 2. Vessel Selection | ACMA selects representative MPSV/LCV; HWCG confirms acceptability with installation company |\n| 3. Environmental | 1-year return winter storm, 2-knot current; API RP 2MET or equivalent metocean basis |\n| 4. Porch Geometry | Detailed STP/AutoCAD from HWCG post-award; preliminary work from RFP figures |\n| 5. FEA | Deck, underdeck, gunwale/sideshell evaluation; sensitivity analysis on load angles in 3 axes |\n| 6. Hydrodynamic (Optional) | RAOs, vertical velocities, Morison-type drag; priced separately |\n| 7. Scope Boundaries | Engineering analysis only; follow-on deployment analysis available separately |\n| 8. Deliverables | Schedule, engineering report with GA drawings, FEA results, tie-down recommendations |\n| 9. Schedule | Porch geometry within 2 weeks, vessel confirmation within 1 week of submission |\n| 10. Commercial | Lump sum base scope; optional hydro priced separately; TSA status to confirm |\n\nAll assumptions trace back to the RFP (Rev. 2) and the Scott McClure / Steve Scanio email exchange. The verification checklist at the bottom tracks the required reviews before finalizing the proposal.","session":"738a0362-a8f4-4066-a376-14259089b364"}
