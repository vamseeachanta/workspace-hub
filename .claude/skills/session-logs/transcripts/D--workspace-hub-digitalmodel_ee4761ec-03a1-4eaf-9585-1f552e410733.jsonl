You can paste this directly to Codex and Gemini:\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Review Brief: WRK-066 Iteration 2\n\n**Commit**: `a507315e` on `main`\n**Parent**: `c187d3ed` (iteration 1: 11 domain groups with 3-layer compat)\n**Scope**: 413 files changed, 891 insertions, 8,736 deletions\n\n### Changes Made\n\n**Phase A**: Deleted 66 ghost directories (only `__pycache__`, no `.py` files) from `src/digitalmodel/` and `src/digitalmodel/modules/`\n\n**Phase B**: Deleted untracked ghost dirs `modules/orcawave/` and `modules/visualization/` (no Python source, real code lives in `solvers/orcawave/` and `visualization/`)\n\n**Phase C**: Deleted `src/digitalmodel/legacy/` (~90 files, 0 production imports). Removed 4 test functions referencing `digitalmodel.legacy`. Removed `\"legacy\"` from `_compat.py` skip set.\n\n**Phase D1**: Flattened `visualization/visualization/` → `visualization/`. Merged `__init__.py`, updated 2 import refs.\n\n**Phase D2**: Flattened `hydrodynamics/hydrodynamics/` → `hydrodynamics/`. Updated `pyproject.toml` CLI entry point. Updated 32 import/patch references across 3 test files.\n\n**Phase E**: Updated 588 stale `digitalmodel.modules.X` references across 112 documentation files to use grouped paths.\n\n**Phase F**: Cleaned empty `__pycache__` dirs. Verified 45/45 compat tests pass, all CLI entry points resolve, 0 test regressions.\n\n### Critical File Diffs\n\n- **`pyproject.toml`**: `hydrodynamics` entry point `hydrodynamics.hydrodynamics.cli:main` → `hydrodynamics.cli:main`\n- **`_compat.py`**: Removed `\"legacy\"` from skip set (line 258)\n- **`hydrodynamics/__init__.py`**: Replaced empty docstring with real exports (10 symbols)\n- **`visualization/__init__.py`**: Added `AgentDashboard` exports from flattened `agent_dashboard.py`\n\n### Review Questions\n\n1. Are the `__init__.py` merges correct (no lost exports)?\n2. Is removing `\"legacy\"` from `_compat.py` skip set safe given the directory is deleted?\n3. Are there any import paths we missed updating?\n4. Should `hydrodynamics.hydrodynamics` get a compat redirect in `_compat.py` for any external consumers?\n\n---\n\nPaste that to both reviewers. After 3 iterations, update the spec's `review` section with their findings.","session":"ee4761ec-03a1-4eaf-9585-1f552e410733"}
