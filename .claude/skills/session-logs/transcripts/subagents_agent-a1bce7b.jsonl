The fix would be something like:\n\n```python\nlength = line.CumulativeLength[line.NumberOfSections]\n```\n\nAll other 144 tests passed successfully, so there are zero regressions elsewhere. The only issue is this `IndexedDataItem` API usage in the 30in cross-validation test at `/d/workspace-hub/digitalmodel/tests/solvers/orcaflex/modular_generator/test_modular_vs_monolithic.py`, line 111.","session":"93d124a4-5d07-4ab3-aa8e-80a97dc6a468"}
