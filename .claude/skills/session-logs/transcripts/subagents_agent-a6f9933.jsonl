The logger name `digitalmodel.orcaflex` is a namespace used for the Python logging system -- this is part of runtime behavior, not documentation. However, since the module is physically at `digitalmodel.solvers.orcaflex`, the logger name should arguably match the actual module path. But the instructions say only to update \"documentation strings and comments\" so I should leave these runtime strings alone since they are part of the actual code logic, not docs.\n\nLet me do a final comprehensive verification.","session":"ee4761ec-03a1-4eaf-9585-1f552e410733"}
