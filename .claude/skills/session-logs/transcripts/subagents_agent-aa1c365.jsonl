The 30-inch pipeline modular-vs-monolithic comparison tests also passed with exact agreement (0.00% difference).\n\nHowever, the **last test timed out** at the 120-second limit. The timeout occurred in the fixture `monolithic_model` inside `test_modular_vs_monolithic.py` (line 209), specifically during `model.CalculateStatics()` -- an OrcaFlex static analysis call that exceeded the 120s timeout. This appears to be a second monolithic model fixture setup (likely for a different pipe size or configuration) that takes longer than the 30-inch case.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All tests up to the final one: **PASSED**\n- Final test: **FAILED** due to `Timeout` (120s) during OrcaFlex `CalculateStatics()` in the `monolithic_model` fixture of `tests/solvers/orcaflex/modular_generator/test_modular_vs_monolithic.py`\n\nIf desired, you could re-run with a higher timeout (e.g., `--timeout=300`) to allow that last statics calculation to complete.","session":"93d124a4-5d07-4ab3-aa8e-80a97dc6a468"}
