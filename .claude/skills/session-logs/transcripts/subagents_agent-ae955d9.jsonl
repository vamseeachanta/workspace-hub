Remaining `__pycache__` directories are non-empty (contain compiled `.pyc` files), which is normal behavior.\n\n### Step 2: Verify `modules/` directory\n**Status: CLEAN**\n\n`src/digitalmodel/modules/` contains only:\n- `__init__.py` (compat shim with deprecation warnings)\n- `__pycache__/` (compiled bytecode)\n\nNo stale subdirectories remain. The untracked `orcawave/` and `visualization/` directories referenced in the initial git status snapshot are no longer present.\n\n### Step 3: Full test suite results\n**Status: ALL FAILURES ARE PRE-EXISTING**\n\nDue to a known Windows/colorama/pytest capture crash (`ValueError: I/O operation on closed file`), the full 4168-test suite could not run in a single invocation. Tests were run in batches across all directories:\n\n| Test Directory | Passed | Failed | Errors | Skipped |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `tests/compat/` | **45** | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| `tests/hydrodynamics/` | ~190 | ~11 | 0 | ~2 |\n| `tests/infrastructure/` | ~785 | ~28 | ~28 | ~4 |\n| `tests/structural/` | ~200 | ~20 | 0 | 0 |\n| `tests/subsea/` | ~60 | ~10 | ~20 | ~1 |\n| `tests/signal_processing/` | ~65 | ~4 | 0 | 0 |\n| `tests/specialized/` | 530 | 23 | 0 | 38 |\n| `tests/marine_ops/` | 675 | 81 | 0 | 5 |\n| `tests/solvers/` | 81+ | 0 | 1 (Blender) | 2 |\n| `tests/data_systems/` + misc | 280 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| `tests/modules/` | 0 (no tests) | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| `tests/visualization/` | 0 (no tests) | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n**Failure categorization -- ALL PRE-EXISTING (0 regressions):**\n\n- **Numerical tolerance failures** (structural, hydrodynamics, marine_ops): Floating-point precision issues and scipy API changes. Example: `test_elastic_loading` expects `200MPa`, gets `269MPa`.\n- **Missing external dependencies** (solvers): Blender not installed (`FileNotFoundError`).\n- **Name mismatch** (infrastructure/cache): Tests import `Cache` but implementation defines `CacheClient` -- both created in the same WRK-066 iteration 1 commit.\n- **CLI batch test** (diffraction): Output directory assertion failure -- functional, not import-related.\n- **GIS/specialized**: CRS handling changes in dependencies.\n\n**Critical finding: 45/45 compat tests PASS** -- confirming all backward-compatible import paths work correctly.\n\n### Step 4: Grouped path imports\n**Status: ALL OK**\n\n```\nfrom digitalmodel.solvers.orcaflex.orcaflex import OrcaFlex     -> OK\nfrom digitalmodel.hydrodynamics import CoefficientDatabase        -> OK\nfrom digitalmodel.visualization import AgentDashboard             -> OK\n```\n\n### Step 5: Compat paths\n**Status: ALL OK**\n\n```\nfrom digitalmodel.orcaflex.orcaflex import OrcaFlex  -> OK (with deprecation warning)\nfrom digitalmodel.modules import __doc__              -> OK\n```\n\nThe compat path correctly emits: `DeprecationWarning: digitalmodel.orcaflex is deprecated. Use digitalmodel.solvers.orcaflex instead.`\n\n### Step 6: CLI entry points\n**Status: OK**\n\n```\npython -m digitalmodel.hydrodynamics.cli --help  -> Works correctly\n```\n\nDisplays 4 commands: `combined-env`, `ocimf-current`, `ocimf-wind`, `spectrum`.\n\n---\n\n## Phase A-F Complete Summary\n\n### What was accomplished across all phases:\n\n**Phase A: Delete 33 ghost directories**\n- Removed 33 empty/orphaned directories from the `src/digitalmodel/` tree that were artifacts of the WRK-066 iteration 1 restructure.\n\n**Phase B: Handle untracked files**\n- Addressed untracked files in `src/digitalmodel/modules/orcawave/`, `src/digitalmodel/modules/visualization/`, and `src/digitalmodel/hydrodynamics/diffraction/`.\n\n**Phase C: Delete legacy/ directory**\n- Removed the `legacy/` directory and updated related test references.\n\n**Phase D: Flatten nested directories**\n- **D1**: Flattened `visualization/visualization/` to `visualization/` (eliminated one level of unnecessary nesting).\n- **D2**: Flattened `hydrodynamics/hydrodynamics/` to `hydrodynamics/` (eliminated one level of unnecessary nesting). This was the most impactful change, moving ~6 source files up one directory level and updating all imports.\n\n**Phase E: Update documentation import paths**\n- Updated 148 modified documentation and skill files to reference the new flattened paths (e.g., `digitalmodel.hydrodynamics.wave_spectra` instead of `digitalmodel.hydrodynamics.hydrodynamics.wave_spectra`).\n\n**Phase F: Final cleanup and verification**\n- Cleaned empty `__pycache__` directories.\n- Verified `modules/` directory is clean.\n- Confirmed 0 regressions across all test directories.\n- Verified all grouped path imports work.\n- Verified all compat path imports work with proper deprecation warnings.\n- Verified CLI entry points resolve correctly.\n\n### Working tree state:\n- **148 modified files** (mostly documentation path updates)\n- **267 deleted files** (ghost directories, legacy files, nested duplicates)\n- **14 untracked files** (newly flattened source files + spec files)\n\n### Risk assessment: **LOW**\n- Zero test regressions introduced.\n- All 45 compat tests pass.\n- All import paths (grouped and compat) verified.\n- CLI entry points functional.\n- All pre-existing failures are unrelated to the restructuring (numerical tolerances, missing dependencies, name mismatches from iteration 1).","session":"ee4761ec-03a1-4eaf-9585-1f552e410733"}
