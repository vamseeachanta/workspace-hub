OD Values**\n\n**Primary Pipeline Line Type: X65+3LPP+CWC80**\n- **OD: 0.762 m** (outer diameter)\n- **ID: 0.7112 m** (inner diameter)\n- **Steel wall thickness: 0.02540 m (25.4 mm)**\n- **Material Density: 7.85 kg/m³ (steel)**\n\n**Secondary Line Type: Winch wire_LT**\n- **OD: 0.08 m (80 mm)**\n- **ID: 0 m** (solid wire)\n\n### 2. **Coating Information**\n\nFrom VariableData section - Coatingsorlinings:\n\n**3LPP+CWC80 Coating Stack:**\n- **Layer 1:** 0.0035 m (3.5 mm) - 3LPP outer coating with density 1.1 kg/m³\n- **Layer 2:** 0.08 m (80 mm) - CWC (Concrete Weight Coating) with density 3 kg/m³\n- **Total coating thickness (radial): 0.0835 m = 83.5 mm**\n- **Total OD with coating: 0.762 + 2(0.0835) = 0.9290 m (929 mm)**\n\n**Alternative 3LPP only:**\n- Layer: 0.0035 m (3.5 mm) - 3LPP with density 1.1 kg/m³\n\n### 3. **\"24in\" Naming Convention**\n\nThe **0.762 m OD does NOT equal 24 inches**:\n- 24 inches = 0.6096 m\n- 0.762 m ≈ 30 inches nominal\n\nThe naming convention \"D24inL4900m\" likely refers to:\n- **D24in** = **Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) of 24 inches** (standard API/ISO designation)\n- In API piping standards, a 24-inch NPS pipe has OD = 0.6096 m (24\"), but this file shows 0.762 m\n- **0.762 m is the actual measured/designed OD for this particular X65 grade pipeline with coatings**\n- This represents the outer surface of the steel pipe before considering the external coating\n\n### 4. **OD Breakdown**\n\n```\nBase Steel OD (as measured in YAML):  0.762 m\n+ 3LPP coating layer:                 3.5 mm\n+ CWC coating layer:                  80 mm\n= Total external OD:                  929 mm (0.929 m)\n\nNote: The 0.762m in LineType definition is the steel pipe OD\n      (after manufacturing), not including external coatings in the\n      LineType geometry - coatings are referenced separately via\n      CoatingThickness: 3LPP+CWC80\n```\n\n### 5. **VariableData Section**\n\n```yaml\nVariableData:\n  Coatingsorlinings:\n    - Name: 3LPP+CWC80\n      LayerThickness, LayerMaterialDensity:\n        -

Ramp Geometry**\n\n**Shape 1: Ramp inclined (Block type)**\n- **Origin:** [-126.35, -25, -5]\n- **Size:** [150, 50, 10] m\n- **Orientation:** [0, 2.27°, 0] (2.27 degree rotation about Y-axis)\n- **Stiffness:** NormalStiffness 10e3, ShearStiffness 100\n- **Connection:** Fixed\n\n**Shape 2: Ramp-curve (Curved plate type)**\n- **Origin:** [4.1, -25, -500.55]\n- **Orientation:** [90°, 90°, 182.27°]\n- **Profile:** \n  - Distance along axis 0m: Diameter 1000m\n  - Distance along axis 50m: Diameter 1000m\n- **Included Angle of Revolution:** 10°\n- **IsHollow:** No\n- **Stiffness:** NormalStiffness 10e3, ShearStiffness 100\n- **Connection:** Fixed\n\n### 7. **FE Segments and Line Types**\n\n**Pipeline line has 6 distinct sections, ALL using same line type:**\n\n```\nLineType, Length, TargetSegmentLength:\n  - [X65+3LPP+CWC80, 11.7m, 0.1m target]      → 117 segments\n  - [X65+3LPP+CWC80, 1879.8m, 0.5m target]    → 3,596 segments\n  - [X65+3LPP+CWC80, 2.9m, 0.5m target]       → 6 segments\n  - [X65+3LPP+CWC80, 1m, 0.5m target]         → 2 segments\n  - [X65+3LPP+CWC80, 3002.4m, 0.5m target]    → 6,005 segments\n  - [X65+3LPP+CWC80, 2.2m, 0.5m target]       → 4 segments\nTotal pipeline length: 4899.9 m ≈ 4900 m (consistent with filename)\nAll sections use identical line type.\n```\n\n**Winch wire line has 1 section:**\n```\nLineType, Length, TargetSegmentLength:\n  - [Winch wire_LT, 165m, 5m target]           → 33 segments\n```\n\n### 8. **Winch Configuration**\n\n**Winch wire line definition:**\n- **Name:** Winch wire\n- **IncludeTorsion:** No\n- **Length:** 165 m (single section)\n- **Target segment length:** 5 m\n- **Line type:** Winch wire_LT (OD 0.08m, solid wire)\n- **End A connection:** 6D buoy1 [position (0,0,0), angles (0°, 0°, -5.754°)]\n- **End B connection:** Fixed at [4960, 0, 2] with orientation [0°, 0°, 180°]\n- **End connection stiffness:** No bending stiffness (0, 0) at both ends\n- **Seabed coupling:** Standard (lateral and axial friction coupled)\n- **Contents:** Uniform, 0 density (empty wire)\n\n---\n\n### **KEY FINDINGS:**\n\n1. **The 0.762m OD is the steel pipe outer diameter** (X65 grade steel), NOT including the external coatings\n2. **\"24in\" in the filename refers to the Nominal Pipe Size (NPS)**, which is an API standard designation\n3. **The actual OD of 0.762m ≈ 30 inches** (not 24 inches like the filename suggests)\n4. **Total OD with coatings is 0.929m** when including the 3.5mm 3LPP + 80mm CWC stack\n5. **All 6 pipeline sections use identical X65+3LPP+CWC80 line type** (homogeneous throughout)\n6. **The pipeline totals 4,899.9 m** across 9,730 FE segments\n7. **Ramp geometry consists of an inclined block and a curved plate** with fixed connections","session":"ef48966e-5b14-4d9f-ae4f-6d8f30d68a2e"}
