{"ts":"2026-02-04T17:46:00.495Z","role":"ai","text":"All changes look correct. Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n## Fixes Applied\n\n### 1. Missing `---` YAML separator (`cli.py:261`)\nThe modular generator's `master.yml` output was missing the YAML document separator (`---`) required by OrcFxAPI before `includefile` directives. Added `'---'` to the `master_lines` list.\n\n### 2. Coating name mismatch (`linetype_builder.py:111-117, 219-252`)\n**Root cause**: `VarDataBuilder` generates coating names like `coating+CWC80`, but `LineTypeBuilder` was extracting `3LPP+CWC80` from the segment type string `X65+3LPP+CWC80`. These didn't match, causing OrcFxAPI to fail with \"Data source does not exist\".\n\n**Fix**: `LineTypeBuilder` now resolves coating references from `context.coating_names` (registered by `VarDataBuilder`) by matching the weight coating suffix. For `X65+3LPP+CWC80`, it finds `coating+CWC80` by matching the `CWC80` suffix. Falls back to segment-type parsing if context is empty.\n\n### 3. Cleaned up test workaround (`test_modular_vs_monolithic.py:204-238`)\nRemoved the `---` insertion patch from the `modular_model` fixture since the generator now produces correct YAML.\n\n## Test Results\n- **245 passed, 11 skipped** (zero failures, zero regressions)\n- 30in cross-validation: still exact match (0.00% difference)\n- All backward compatibility tests pass (including `test_vardata_section_structure` and `test_line_types_section_structure`)\n- 11 skips are all OrcFxAPI-dependent tests that need the runtime or pre-computed `.sim` files","session":"93d124a4-5d07-4ab3-aa8e-80a97dc6a468"}

Here's a summary of everything completed:\n\n### Task 5: Winch wire generation fix (completed)\n\n**`lines_builder.py`** — Two changes:\n1. **`build()` method** (line 53-61): Replaced dead `pass` with actual winch wire generation — computes total pipeline length, calls `_build_winch_wire_line()`, registers `\"Winch wire\"` in `additional_line_names` for GroupsBuilder\n2. **`_build_winch_wire_line()` method** (lines 271-326): Completely rewritten — now connects `6D buoy1` (End A) to `Fixed` at `[pipeline_length+60, 0, 2]` (End B), using `Winch wire_LT`, 165m length, 5m mesh, `StaticsStep1: \"User specified\"`\n\n**`test_backward_compat.py`** — Updated assertions for 2 lines instead of 1, added `Winch wire` group check.\n\n### Task 8: Along-length no-load comparison (completed)\n\n**`test_modular_vs_monolithic.py`** — Phase E additions:\n- `StaticRangeResults` dataclass for along-length data\n- `extract_static_range_results()` using `line.RangeGraph(\"Effective Tension\")` and `line.RangeGraph(\"Bend Moment\")`\n- `_zero_environment()` helper — zeros `WaveHeight`, `RefCurrentSpeed`, `WindSpeed`\n- 4 session-scoped fixtures: `modular_noload_model`, `monolithic_noload_model`, `modular_range_results`, `monolithic_range_results`\n- 5 tests in `TestAlongLengthNoLoadComparison`: convergence checks, finite results, tension profile comparison (10%/20kN tolerance), bending moment profile comparison (20%/10kN·m tolerance)\n- Interpolates to 10 common positions to handle different mesh densities\n- Prints comparison tables with `-s` flag for engineering review\n\n### Task 7: 24in modular regenerated (completed)\n\nThe modular output at `docs/.../24in_pipeline/modular/` now includes the winch wire in:\n- `includes/05_line_types.yml` — `Winch wire_LT` line type\n- `includes/07_lines.yml` — `Winch wire` line (6D buoy1 → Fixed[4960, 0, 2])\n- `includes/10_groups.yml` — `Winch wire: Model`\n\n### Test results\n- **239 passed**, 0 failures (all non-OrcFxAPI tests)\n- Phase E tests will skip gracefully without OrcFxAPI\n\n### To run the model manually\nLoad `docs/.../24in_pipeline/modular/master.yml` in OrcFxAPI and run statics. The winch wire should now provide End B restraint for convergence. For the no-load comparison, also save the result as `statics_noload.sim` to speed up future test runs.","session":"93d124a4-5d07-4ab3-aa8e-80a97dc6a468"}
