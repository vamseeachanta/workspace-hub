     * Phase 0 generates research.md
     * Phase 1 generates data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
     * Phase 2 generates tasks.md
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding
   - Any technical constraints or dependencies mentioned
   - BEFORE proceeding, inspect FEATURE_SPEC for a `## Clarifications` section with at least one `Session` subheading. If missing or clearly ambiguous areas remain (vague adjectives, unresolved critical choices), PAUSE and instruct the user to run `/clarify` first to reduce rework. Only continue if: (a) Clarifications exist OR (b) an explicit user override is provided (e.g., "proceed without clarification"). Do not attempt to fabricate clarifications yourself.
   - Check Progress Tracking shows all phases complete
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Confirm no ERROR states in execution
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Ensure all required artifacts were generated
   - Follow error handling and gate checks as specified
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Functional and non-functional requirements
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - Incorporate user-provided details from arguments into Technical Context: for WRK-032
   - Incorporate user-provided details from arguments into Technical Context: or WRK-032
   - Let the template guide artifact generation in $SPECS_DIR:
   - Load `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` (already copied to IMPL_PLAN path)
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Report final status with summary of completed work
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Run the Execution Flow (main) function steps 1-9
   - Set Input path to FEATURE_SPEC
   - Success criteria and acceptance criteria
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - The feature requirements and user stories
   - The template is self-contained and executable
   - Update Progress Tracking as you complete each phase
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Verify all required tasks are completed

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.
1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from the repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. All future file paths must be absolute.
2. Load and analyze the implementation context:

Capture and process work items (features, bugs, tasks) across workspace-hub repositories. Two-phase system: rapidly log items, then triage and delegate by complexity.
Given the implementation details provided as an argument, do this:
Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.
Use absolute paths with the repository root for all file operations to avoid path issues.
