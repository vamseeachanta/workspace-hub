# Archived Skills

Skills moved here during zombie cleanup (WRK-094 Phase 2, 2026-02-12).

These skills were identified as unused/redundant and archived to reduce clutter.
They are preserved here for reference and can be restored if needed.

## Archive Criteria

- **No references** in CLAUDE.md, agent-skills-map.yaml, or active work queue items
- **Superseded** by built-in Claude Code capabilities (Task tool, etc.)
- **Duplicate** of another skill in a different category
- **Aspirational** design docs never implemented as executable skills
- **Auto-generated** commit pattern records with no executable content
- **Third-party tool wrappers** for tools not used in the workspace

## Restoring a Skill

Move the skill directory back to its original location under `.claude/skills/`.
The original category structure is preserved in the archive paths.
