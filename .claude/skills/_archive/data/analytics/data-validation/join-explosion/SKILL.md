# Join Explosion (+6)

## Join Explosion


**The problem**: A many-to-many join silently multiplies rows, inflating counts and sums.

**How to detect**:
```sql
-- Check row count before and after join
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_a;  -- 1,000
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_a a JOIN table_b b ON a.id = b.a_id;  -- 3,500 (uh oh)
```

**How to prevent**:
- Always check row counts after joins
- If counts increase, investigate the join relationship (is it really 1:1 or 1:many?)
- Use `COUNT(DISTINCT a.id)` instead of `COUNT(*)` when counting entities through joins


## Survivorship Bias


**The problem**: Analyzing only entities that exist today, ignoring those that were deleted, churned, or failed.

**Examples**:
- Analyzing user behavior of "current users" misses churned users
- Looking at "companies using our product" ignores those who evaluated and left
- Studying properties of "successful" outcomes without "unsuccessful" ones

**How to prevent**: Ask "who is NOT in this dataset?" before drawing conclusions.


## Incomplete Period Comparison


**The problem**: Comparing a partial period to a full period.

**Examples**:
- "January revenue is $500K vs. December's $800K" -- but January isn't over yet
- "This week's signups are down" -- checked on Wednesday, comparing to a full prior week

**How to prevent**: Always filter to complete periods, or compare same-day-of-month / same-number-of-days.


## Denominator Shifting


**The problem**: The denominator changes between periods, making rates incomparable.

**Examples**:
- Conversion rate improves because you changed how you count "eligible" users
- Churn rate changes because the definition of "active" was updated

**How to prevent**: Use consistent definitions across all compared periods. Note any definition changes.


## Average of Averages


**The problem**: Averaging pre-computed averages gives wrong results when group sizes differ.

**Example**:
- Group A: 100 users, average revenue $50
- Group B: 10 users, average revenue $200
- Wrong: Average of averages = ($50 + $200) / 2 = $125
- Right: Weighted average = (100*$50 + 10*$200) / 110 = $63.64

**How to prevent**: Always aggregate from raw data. Never average pre-aggregated averages.


## Timezone Mismatches


**The problem**: Different data sources use different timezones, causing misalignment.

**Examples**:
- Event timestamps in UTC vs. user-facing dates in local time
- Daily rollups that use different cutoff times

**How to prevent**: Standardize all timestamps to a single timezone (UTC recommended) before analysis. Document the timezone used.


## Selection Bias in Segmentation


**The problem**: Segments are defined by the outcome you're measuring, creating circular logic.

**Examples**:
- "Users who completed onboarding have higher retention" -- obviously, they self-selected
- "Power users generate more revenue" -- they became power users BY generating revenue

**How to prevent**: Define segments based on pre-treatment characteristics, not outcomes.
