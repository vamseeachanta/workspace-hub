```

## Best Practices

### Do

1. Start with ICP definition
2. Focus on fewer, higher-quality channels
3. Create valuable lead magnets
4. Nurture before selling
5. Track attribution carefully
6. Continuously optimize conversion

### Don't

1. Buy email lists

6. Neglect existing leads

## Error Handling

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Low conversion rate | Poor offer/targeting | Test new lead magnets, refine ICP |
| High CAC | Inefficient channels | Shift budget to performing channels |
| Low lead quality | Too broad targeting | Tighten ICP, add qualification |
| Email deliverability | List hygiene issues | Clean list, warm up domain |
