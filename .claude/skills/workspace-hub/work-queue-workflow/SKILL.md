# Work-Queue Workflow

This skill is a clear entrypoint for users who ask for the "work-queue workflow".
It delegates to canonical `work-queue` and `workflow-gatepass` contracts.

## Start-to-Finish Chain

1. Run `session-start`.
2. Use `/work` to select/create the WRK item.
3. Ensure plan exists and user approval explicitly names WRK ID.
4. Execute claim -> implement -> test -> evidence capture.
5. Verify close gate evidence and integrated/repo tests (3-5 pass records).
6. Close and archive using queue scripts.

## Source of Truth

- Process contract: `.claude/work-queue/process.md`
- Execution workflow: `coordination/workspace/work-queue/SKILL.md`
- Gate enforcement: `workspace-hub/workflow-gatepass/SKILL.md`
