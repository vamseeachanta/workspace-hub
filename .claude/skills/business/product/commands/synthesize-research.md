# /synthesize-research - Synthesize User Research

Synthesize user research from interviews, surveys, feedback, and other sources into structured insights.

## Usage

```
/synthesize-research <research data or source>
```

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Inputs

Accept from pasted text, uploaded files, and connected tools (knowledge base, user feedback, product analytics, meeting transcription). Ask about research type, participant count, investigation focus, and business decisions involved.

### 2. Process Each Source

Extract:
- Key observations
- Direct quotes
- Actual behaviors
- Pain points
- Positive signals
- User context

### 3. Identify Themes

Apply thematic analysis:
- Group observations
- Count frequency
- Assess impact severity
- Note contradictions
- Use a priority matrix balancing frequency and impact

### 4. Generate Synthesis

**Research Overview**: Methodology, research questions, timeframe

**Key Findings** (5-8 total): Clear statements with supporting evidence, frequency counts, impact assessment, and confidence levels. Ordered by priority.

**User Segments**: Distinct groups with characteristics, behaviors, needs, and pain points

**Opportunity Areas**: Unmet needs, solution gaps, and capability gaps ranked by impact

**Recommendations**: Specific, actionable suggestions tied to findings and prioritized

**Open Questions**: Research gaps and follow-up areas

## Quality Standards

- Let data drive findings rather than forcing narratives
- Distinguish stated preferences from actual behaviors
- Include attributed quotes (max 125 characters per quote)
- Explicitly state confidence levels based on evidence strength
- Treat contradictions as revealing distinct segments
- Ensure recommendations are specific enough to action
