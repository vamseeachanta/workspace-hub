## Competitive Research Methodology

### Research Sources

#### Primary Sources (Direct from Competitor)
- **Website**: homepage, product pages, pricing, about page, careers
- **Blog and resource center**: content themes, publishing frequency, depth
- **Social media profiles**: messaging, engagement, content strategy
- **Product demos and free trials**: UX, features, onboarding experience
- **Webinars and events**: topics, speakers, audience engagement
- **Press releases and newsroom**: announcements, partnerships, milestones
- **Job postings**: hiring signals that reveal strategic priorities

#### Secondary Sources (Third-Party)
- **Review sites**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, Product Hunt -- customer sentiment themes
- **Analyst reports**: Gartner, Forrester, IDC -- market positioning and category placement
- **News coverage**: TechCrunch, industry publications -- funding, partnerships, narrative
- **Social listening**: mentions, sentiment, share of voice across social platforms
- **SEO tools**: keyword rankings, organic traffic estimates, content gaps
- **Financial filings**: revenue, growth rate, investment areas (for public companies)
- **Community forums**: Reddit, Discourse, industry Slack communities -- user sentiment

### Research Process
1. **Set scope**: define which competitors and what aspects to analyze
2. **Gather data**: systematically collect information from sources above
3. **Organize findings**: structure by competitor, then by dimension
4. **Analyze patterns**: identify themes, strengths, weaknesses, and trends
5. **Compare to your position**: map findings against your own positioning
6. **Synthesize insights**: extract actionable takeaways and opportunities
7. **Date-stamp everything**: competitive intelligence has a short shelf life

### Research Cadence
- **Deep competitive analysis**: quarterly
- **Competitive monitoring**: monthly
- **Real-time alerts**: ongoing

## Messaging Comparison Frameworks

### Messaging Matrix

| Dimension | Your Company | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Tagline/Headline | | | | |
| Core value proposition | | | | |
| Primary audience | | | | |
| Key differentiator claim | | | | |
| Tone/Voice | | | | |
| Proof points used | | | | |
| Category framing | | | | |
| Primary CTA | | | | |

### Narrative Analysis

Identify each competitor's story arc:
- **Villain**: what problem or enemy they position against
- **Hero**: who is the hero in their story
- **Transformation**: what before/after do they promise
- **Stakes**: what happens if you do not act

## Content Gap Analysis

### Content Audit Comparison

| Topic/Theme | Your Content | Competitor A | Competitor B | Gap? |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|------|

### Identifying Content Opportunities
1. Topics they cover that you do not
2. Topics you cover that they do not
3. Formats they use that you do not
4. Audience segments they address that you do not
5. Search terms they rank for that you do not
