## Writing Best Practices by Channel

- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Include subheadings every 200-300 words
- Use bullet points and numbered lists
- Write in active voice
- Front-load key information in each section

### Social Media
- **LinkedIn**: professional but human, personal stories perform well, 1,300 characters sweet spot
- **Twitter/X**: concise and punchy, strong opening words, threads for longer narratives
- **Instagram**: visual-first captions, storytelling hooks, hashtags in first comment
- **Facebook**: conversational tone, questions drive comments

### Email
- One primary CTA per email
- Keep body copy scannable
- Mobile-first design
- Test everything: subject lines, send times, CTA copy, layout

### Web (Landing Pages, Product Pages)
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Use "you" language
- Every section should answer "so what?"
- Reduce friction near CTAs

## Headline and Hook Formulas

### Headline Formulas
- **How to [achieve result] [without common obstacle]**
- **[Number] [adjective] ways to [achieve result]**
- **Why [common belief] is wrong (and what to do instead)**
- **The [adjective] guide to [topic]**
- **[Do this], not [that]**

### Hook Formulas (Opening Lines)
- **Surprising statistic**
- **Contrarian statement**
- **Question**
- **Scenario**
- **Bold claim**
- **Story opening**

## Call-to-Action Best Practices

### CTA Principles
- Use action verbs: "Get", "Start", "Download", "Join", "Try", "See"
- Be specific about what happens next
- Create urgency when genuine
- Reduce risk: "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime"
- One primary CTA per page or email

## SEO Fundamentals for Content

### Keyword Strategy
- One primary keyword and 2-3 secondary keywords per piece
- Use the primary keyword in: headline, first paragraph, one subheading, meta description, URL slug
- Do not keyword-stuff -- write for humans first

- Meta description: under 160 characters
- URL slug: short, descriptive, includes primary keyword
- H1: one per page
- Image alt text: descriptive, includes keyword where relevant
- Internal links: 2-3 links to related content

## Tone Adaptation Across Channels and Contexts

| Customer success story | Celebratory, specific, crediting the customer |
| Thought leadership | Authoritative, nuanced, evidence-based |

### Tone Adaptation Rule
The voice attributes remain fixed. Tone dials them up or down based on context.

## Terminology Management

### Preferred Terms

| Use This | Not This | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| sign up (verb) | signup (verb) | "signup" is the noun form |

| website | web site | One word |

### Inclusive Language
- Use gender-neutral language

- Use person-first language where appropriate
- Avoid culturally specific idioms that may not translate
- Use "simple" or "straightforward" instead of "easy"

### Industry Jargon Management
- Define which technical terms the audience understands without explanation
