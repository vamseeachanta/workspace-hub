# Campaign Planning Skill

Frameworks and guidance for planning, structuring, and executing marketing campaigns.

## Campaign Framework: Objective, Audience, Message, Channel, Measure

Every campaign should be built on this five-part framework:

### 1. Objective
Define what success looks like before planning anything else.

- **Awareness**: increase brand or product visibility (measured by reach, impressions, share of voice)
- **Consideration**: drive engagement and education (measured by content engagement, email signups, webinar attendance)
- **Conversion**: generate leads or sales (measured by signups, demos, purchases, pipeline)
- **Retention**: re-engage existing customers (measured by churn reduction, upsell, NPS)
- **Advocacy**: turn customers into promoters (measured by referrals, reviews, UGC)

Good objectives are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.

### 2. Audience
Define who you are trying to reach with enough specificity to guide messaging and channel decisions.

- **Demographics**: role/title, seniority, company size, industry
- **Psychographics**: motivations, pain points, goals, objections
- **Behavioral**: where they consume content, how they buy, what they have engaged with before
- **Buying stage**: are they unaware of the problem, researching solutions, or ready to buy?

### 3. Message
Craft the core message and supporting points:

- **Core message**: one sentence that captures what you want the audience to think, feel, or do
- **Supporting messages**: 3-4 points that provide evidence, address objections, or elaborate on benefits
- **Proof points**: data, case studies, testimonials, or third-party validation
- **Differentiation**: what makes your offering different from alternatives

Message hierarchy:
1. Why should I care? (addresses the pain point or opportunity)
2. What is the solution? (positions your offering)
3. Why you? (differentiates from alternatives)
4. What should I do? (call to action)

### 4. Channel
Select channels based on where your audience is, not where you are most comfortable.

### 5. Measure
Define how you will know the campaign worked.
