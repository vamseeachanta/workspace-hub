# Workpaper Requirements (+2)

## Workpaper Requirements


Every control test should be documented with:

1. **Control identification:**
   - Control number/ID
   - Control description (what is done, by whom, how often)
   - Control type (manual, automated, IT-dependent manual)
   - Control frequency
   - Risk and assertion addressed

2. **Test design:**
   - Test objective (what you are trying to determine)
   - Test procedures (step-by-step instructions)
   - Expected evidence (what you expect to see if the control is effective)
   - Sample selection methodology and rationale

3. **Test execution:**
   - Population description and size
   - Sample selection details (method, items selected)
   - Results for each sample item (pass/fail with specific evidence examined)
   - Exceptions noted with full description

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Overall assessment (effective / deficiency / significant deficiency / material weakness)
   - Basis for conclusion
   - Impact assessment for any exceptions
   - Compensating controls considered (if applicable)

5. **Sign-off:**
   - Tester name and date
   - Reviewer name and date


## Evidence Standards


**Sufficient evidence includes:**
- Screenshots showing system-enforced controls
- Signed/initialed approval documents
- Email approvals with identifiable approver and date
- System audit logs showing who performed the action and when
- Re-performed calculations with matching results
- Observation notes (with date, location, observer)

**Insufficient evidence:**
- Verbal confirmations alone (must be corroborated)
- Undated documents
- Evidence without identifiable performer/approver
- Generic system reports without date/time stamps
- "Per discussion with [name]" without corroborating documentation
