# Contract Review Skill Documentation

This resource outlines a systematic methodology for analyzing commercial agreements against organizational standards. The framework emphasizes that such reviews support legal workflows but do not constitute legal counsel.

## Core Methodology

The approach involves identifying contract type and party role, then conducting clause-by-clause analysis. Key areas examined include liability caps, indemnification scope, IP ownership, data protection compliance, termination provisions, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

## Severity Classification System

Deviations are categorized as:

- **GREEN (Acceptable)**: Aligns with standard positions; no action needed
- **YELLOW (Negotiate)**: Falls outside preferences but remains negotiable; requires redline suggestions
- **RED (Escalate)**: Poses material risk or triggers escalation criteria; demands senior review

## Redline Best Practices

Effective redlines provide specific language ready for insertion, explain rationales suitable for counterparty sharing, offer fallback positions, and prioritize critical versus aspirational changes. Format includes clause reference, current language, proposed alternatives, rationale, priority level, and backup positions.

## Negotiation Framework

Issues organize into three tiers: Tier 1 (deal-breakers requiring resolution), Tier 2 (strong preferences with negotiation room), and Tier 3 (concession candidates). Strategy involves leading with critical items while trading lower-priority concessions.

The methodology emphasizes balanced, commercially reasonable positions rather than aggressive stances that impede negotiations.
