## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**Issue: Low engagement/open rates**
- Cause: Unclear subject line or wrong timing
- Solution: A/B test subject lines, send Tuesday-Thursday 10am-2pm

**Issue: Confusion after announcement**
- Cause: Missing context or unclear next steps
- Solution: Add "Why" section and explicit action items

**Issue: Message feels impersonal**
- Cause: Overly formal or template-heavy
- Solution: Add personal anecdotes, use "we" and "you"

**Issue: Important info buried**
- Cause: Not using inverted pyramid structure
- Solution: Lead with key point, details after
