# Triage Support Documentation

This outlines a **triage workflow** for categorizing and prioritizing customer support tickets.

## Core Purpose
The triage process helps teams categorize, prioritize, and route an incoming support ticket with structured assessment and initial response guidance.

## Workflow Stages

The six-step process includes:

1. **Parse the Issue** -- Extract the core problem, symptoms, customer context, urgency signals, and emotional state
2. **Categorize and Prioritize** -- Assign primary/secondary categories, priority levels (P1-P4), and product areas
3. **Check for Duplicates** -- Search support platforms, knowledge bases, and project trackers
4. **Determine Routing** -- Recommend appropriate team or queue based on category and complexity
5. **Generate Output** -- Produce structured triage results with summary, key details, routing, and suggested response
6. **Offer Next Steps** -- Suggest follow-up actions like drafting responses or escalations

## Key Output Elements

The triage assessment includes category classification, priority justification, impact analysis, workaround availability, routing rationale, and a draft initial customer response.

The documentation emphasizes acknowledging issues, setting expectations, and providing available workarounds in first contact with customers.
