# Draft Response Tool Overview

This documentation outlines a systematic workflow for creating professional customer-facing responses. The process involves four key phases:

**Understanding context** requires identifying the customer, situation type, urgency level, communication channel, relationship stage, and stakeholder level to tailor appropriately.

**Research gathering** suggests consulting previous correspondence, internal discussions, CRM data, support tickets, and knowledge bases to inform accurate, informed replies.

**Response generation** follows situation-specific templates -- whether answering questions, addressing issues, handling escalations, delivering difficult news, sharing wins, or declining requests.

**Quality assurance** includes verification steps such as tone alignment, authorization limits, accuracy checks, and stakeholder-appropriate language before finalizing.

The tool emphasizes taking ownership during escalations, being direct with bad news, honestly explaining decisions, and maintaining clarity about next steps and accountability. Post-submission, the workflow offers iteration options including tone adjustments, content modifications, and follow-up message preparation.
