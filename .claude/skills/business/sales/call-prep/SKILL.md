# Call Prep Skill Overview

The **call-prep** skill prepares sales professionals for meetings by combining user-provided context with web research and optional CRM/email/chat/calendar integrations.

## Core Functionality

**Standalone mode** requires only the company name and meeting type. The skill then:
- Conducts web searches for recent news and leadership changes
- Researches company background and industry context
- Generates a structured prep brief with discovery questions

**Enhanced mode** activates when users connect tools like CRM systems or email platforms, automatically pulling account history, contact details, and prior interactions.

## Output Structure

The skill produces a formatted brief including:
- Account snapshot with company details
- Attendee profiles with background information
- Contextual history and recent company news
- A suggested meeting agenda tailored to the call type
- Discovery questions to guide conversation
- Anticipated objections with response strategies

## Key Features

The skill adapts to different meeting scenarios -- discovery calls emphasize information gathering, demos focus on tailored feature presentation, and negotiations center on objection handling. More context equals better prep, so sharing prior emails, notes, and attendee details enhances accuracy.
