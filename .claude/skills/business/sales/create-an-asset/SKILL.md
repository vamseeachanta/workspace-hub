# Create an Asset -- Skill Documentation

This is a comprehensive guide for generating tailored sales assets. Here's what it covers:

## Core Purpose
The skill creates professional sales deliverables -- landing pages, presentation decks, one-pagers, and workflow demos -- customized to prospect context, audience needs, and business goals.

## Seven-Phase Workflow

**Phase 0: Context Detection** -- Identifies seller company, collects prospect details, audience type, asset purpose, and preferred format.

**Phase 1: Research** -- Gathers prospect financials, leadership, brand colors, industry trends, and technology landscape based on context richness.

**Phase 2: Structure Decision** -- Maps purpose to recommended sections for each format type.

**Phase 3: Content Generation** -- Creates tailored copy referencing specific pain points and using prospect language.

**Phase 4: Visual Design** -- Applies dark theme styling with prospect brand colors, professional typography, and smooth animations.

**Phase 5: Clarifying Questions** -- Summarizes understanding and asks format-specific questions before building.

**Phase 6: Build & Delivery** -- Generates self-contained HTML file with instructions for deployment and sharing.

**Phase 7: Iteration Support** -- Enables refinements to colors, sections, tone, and structure post-delivery.

## Key Features

- **Format flexibility**: Interactive pages, decks, one-pagers, or technical workflow diagrams
- **Audience targeting**: Executive, technical, operations, or mixed groups
- **Research-driven**: Automatically extracts company metrics, leadership, brand guidelines
- **Workflow-specific guidance**: Component definitions, flow steps, scenario narratives for architecture demos
- **Quality assurance**: 20-point checklist covering content, visual, functional, and professional standards

All assets output as single-file HTML with inline CSS/JavaScript for easy sharing and deployment.
