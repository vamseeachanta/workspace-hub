# Account Research Skill Overview

The **account-research** skill enables you to gather actionable sales intelligence on companies and individuals before outreach. It operates in three tiers:

## Core Functionality

**Always Available (Web Search):**
The skill conducts automatic web searches to compile company overviews, recent news, hiring signals, key personnel, and product information. You activate it with triggers like "Research [company]" or "Look up [person]."

**Supercharged (With Connectors):**
When you connect enrichment tools or CRM systems, the skill gains access to verified contact details, technology stacks, organizational charts, prior relationship history, and opportunity records.

## Research Output

Results follow a structured format including:
- Quick assessment of relevance and outreach angle
- Company profile with foundational details
- Recent news tied to sales implications
- Leadership team information with talking points
- Technology stack details (when enrichment connected)
- Prior relationship context (when CRM connected)
- Qualification signals highlighting strengths and concerns
- Recommended entry points and discovery questions

## Execution Process

The skill sequences five steps: parsing your request, conducting web searches, pulling enrichment data if available, checking CRM history if connected, and synthesizing all sources into actionable intelligence.

**Best Practice:** Include specific domains or full names for more precise results.
