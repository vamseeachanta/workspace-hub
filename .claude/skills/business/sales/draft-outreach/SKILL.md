# Draft Outreach Skill Overview

This tool helps create personalized outreach messages by researching prospects first. Here's what it does:

## Core Function

The skill follows a three-step process: research the prospect, draft a personalized message, and deliver it through available channels. This skill never sends generic outreach -- it always researches the prospect first to personalize the message.

## Key Features

**Research Phase:**
- Conducts web searches by default
- Integrates with enrichment tools for verified contact info
- Accesses CRM data for relationship history
- Identifies personalization hooks from trigger events, mutual connections, or recent company news

**Message Creation:**
The skill avoids generic patterns like "I hope this email finds you well" or "I'm reaching out because..." Instead, it prioritizes opening with something specific you learned about the prospect.

**Output Options:**
- Email drafts (if email connector available)
- LinkedIn connection requests and follow-up messages
- Plain text for manual copying

## Supported Triggers

Users activate the skill with requests like "draft outreach to [person/company]," "write cold email to [prospect]," or "reach out to [name]."

The tool adapts its approach based on relationship type -- cold outreach, warm introductions, re-engagement, or post-event follow-ups -- each with distinct message templates and tone.
