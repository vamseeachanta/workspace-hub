# Daily Sales Briefing Skill Overview

The **daily-briefing** skill provides sales professionals with a prioritized action plan for their day. It operates in two modes:

## Core Functionality

**Standalone mode** works with information you provide directly -- just share your meetings and key deals. The skill then organizes these into a scannable 2-minute briefing.

**Supercharged mode** activates when you connect optional tools: calendar (auto-pulls meetings), CRM (surfaces pipeline alerts and tasks), email (flags priority messages), and enrichment data (overnight account signals).

## How to Trigger

Use phrases like "morning briefing," "daily brief," "what's on my plate today," or "prep my day."

## Output Structure

The briefing includes:
- A single top priority for the day
- Today's pipeline metrics
- Meeting schedule with prep notes
- Pipeline alerts (deals needing attention, closing soon)
- Email priorities (responses needed, waiting replies)
- Three suggested actions ranked by urgency

## Key Features

The skill prioritizes based on deal value, meeting importance, and timeline urgency. You can request a "quick brief" for an abbreviated version or use "wrap up my day" for end-of-day summaries.

**No connectors needed** -- it adapts to whatever context you provide manually.
