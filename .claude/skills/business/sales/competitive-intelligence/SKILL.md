# Competitive Intelligence Skill Overview

This skill generates an **interactive HTML battlecard** for competitive sales enablement. Here's what it does:

## Core Functionality

The tool researches competitors through web search and optional integrations (CRM, docs, chat, transcripts), then outputs a self-contained HTML artifact with:

- **Comparison matrix** -- feature, pricing, and positioning overview
- **Clickable competitor tabs** -- expandable cards with differentiation, talk tracks, objections, and "landmine questions"
- **Your company card** -- recent releases and key differentiators

## Execution Process

The skill follows a five-phase workflow:

1. **Gather context** -- Your company, product, and competitor names
2. **Research your company** -- Product info, pricing, recent releases
3. **Research competitors** -- Features, pricing, news, reviews, hiring signals
4. **Pull connected data** -- Win/loss patterns, existing battlecards, field intel, call transcripts
5. **Build HTML artifact** -- Structured, dark-themed interface with tab navigation

## Data Per Competitor

Each battlecard includes: company profile, positioning statement, recent releases, win/loss areas, pricing intelligence, scenario-based talk tracks, common objections with responses, and strategic "landmine questions" designed to expose weaknesses.

## Recommended Refresh Cadence

- **Monthly** -- catch new releases and pricing changes
- **Before major deals** -- deep dive on specific competitor
- **After win/loss** -- update with new patterns
- **On competitor announcements** -- immediate updates
