# 🔍 Verification Commands

Truth verification system for ensuring code quality and correctness with a 0.95 accuracy threshold.

## Overview

The verification system provides real-time truth checking and validation for all agent tasks, ensuring high-quality outputs and automatic rollback on failures.

## Subcommands

### `verify check`
Run verification checks on current code or agent outputs.

```bash
```

### `verify rollback`
Automatically rollback changes that fail verification.

```bash
```

### `verify report`
Generate verification reports and metrics.

```bash
```

### `verify dashboard`
Launch interactive verification dashboard.

```bash
```

## Configuration

Default threshold: **0.95** (95% accuracy required)

```json
{
  "verification": {
    "threshold": 0.95,
    "autoRollback": true,
    "gitIntegration": true,
    "hooks": {
      "preCommit": true,
      "preTask": true,
      "postEdit": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration

### With Swarm Commands
```bash
```

### With Training Pipeline
```bash
```

### With Pair Programming
```bash
```

## Metrics

- **Truth Score**: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Confidence Level**: Statistical confidence in verification
- **Rollback Rate**: Percentage of changes rolled back
- **Quality Improvement**: Trend over time

## Examples

### Basic Verification
```bash
# Verify current directory

# Verify with custom threshold

# Verify and auto-fix
```

### Advanced Workflows
```bash
# Continuous verification during development

# Batch verification

# Integration testing
```

## Performance

- Verification latency: <100ms for most checks
- Rollback time: <1s for git-based rollback
- Dashboard refresh: Real-time via WebSocket
