# SPARC Batch Executor Mode

## Purpose
Parallel task execution specialist using batch operations.

## Activation

### Option 1: Using MCP Tools (Preferred in Claude Code)
```javascript

  task_description: "process multiple files",
  options: {
    parallel: true,
    batch_size: 10
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Using NPX CLI (Fallback when MCP not available)
```bash
# Use when running from terminal or MCP tools unavailable

# For alpha features
```

### Option 3: Local Installation
```bash
```
