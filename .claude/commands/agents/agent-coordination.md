Coordination patterns for multi-agent collaboration.

## Coordination Patterns

### Hierarchical
Queen-led with worker specialization
```bash
```

### Mesh
Peer-to-peer collaboration

```

### Adaptive
Dynamic topology based on workload

```

## Best Practices
- Use hierarchical for complex projects
- Use mesh for research tasks
- Use adaptive for unknown workloads
