### Refactor - Reference

I spend about 20% of my time on refactoring. Ofc all of that is done by agents, I don?t waste my time doing that manually. Refactor days are great when I need less focus or I?m tired, since I can make great progress without the need of too much focus or clear thinking.

Typical refactor work is using jscpd for code duplication, knip for dead code, running eslint?s react-compiler and deprecation plugins, checking if we introduced api routes that can be consolidated, maintaining my docs, breaking apart files that grew too large, adding tests and code comments for tricky parts, updating dependencies, tool upgrades, file restructuring, finding and rewriting slow tests, mentioning modern react patterns and rewriting code (e.g. you might not need useEffect). There?s always something to do.

You could make the argument that this could be done on each commit, I do find these phases of iterating fast and then maintaining and improving the codebase - basically paying back some technical debt, to be far more productive, and overall far more fun.
