## Verdict

**APPROVE with Minor Issues**

## Summary

WRK-624 proposes converting the work-queue from informal conventions into a machine-enforceable 8-stage lifecycle contract. The plan introduces a three-route review matrix (A/B/C), mandatory artifacts (resource packs, review evidence, HTML gates, close evidence), a phased migration strategy for legacy WRKs, and integration with the ecosystem learning loop. Complexity is marked "critical" with status "implemented" at Phase 3.

## Issues Found

**P2 — Truncation hides scope**
Two `[truncated for Claude compact bundle]` cuts remove Phase 2 rollout details and the full review matrix body. Any findings in the omitted sections cannot be evaluated. The bundle format itself is a blind spot for the reviewer.

**P2 — "Status: implemented" conflicts with phased rollout dates**
The metadata says `status: implemented` but Phase 1 starts 2026-02-27 and Phase 2 ends 2026-03-21. Either the status is stale/wrong, or "implemented" refers only to plan scaffolding — the distinction should be explicit in the metadata.

**P2 — No hard-fail cutoff dates**
The acceptance criteria require a migration matrix with a `hard_fail_cutoff` date, but the visible rollout section only shows `start` / `target_completion`. The cutoff is the enforcement moment; its absence here means Phase 1 could slip without a gate firing.

**P3 — Route A auto-escalation trigger is undefined**
The matrix states "auto-escalate to 3-model review on risk signals" but does not define what signals trigger escalation. Without a concrete list, the gate is unenforceable and discretionary.

**P3 — Dependency contract table not visible**
Acceptance criteria require a dependency contract table, but it is not present in the bundle. If it was truncated, that is a bundle construction bug; if it was omitted from the plan, it is a P2 gap.

**P3 — Concurrency tests underspecified**
"Conflicting claim attempts" and "stale session ownership recovery" are listed but there is no detail on what tooling, harness, or assertion style implements them. For a "critical" complexity item this is thin.

## Suggestions

- Regenerate the compact bundle without truncation, or ensure each `[truncated]` block has a section-level summary so reviewers are not blind to content.
- Align `status:` with actual enforcement state — consider `partial` or `phase-1-active` until Phase 3 is complete.
- Add a `hard_fail_cutoff` field to each phase block (even if it matches `target_completion`).
- Define Route A risk signals as an explicit enumerated list (e.g., `files_changed > N`, `external_api: true`, `complexity: high`).
- Surface the dependency contract table in the bundle or link to it directly.
- Expand concurrency test descriptions to name the test harness and expected assertions.

## Questions for Author

1. What does "implemented" in the metadata mean — is the enforcement tooling deployed, or just the plan document written?
2. What are the concrete risk signals that trigger Route A → Route B escalation?
3. Was the dependency contract table omitted from the bundle intentionally, or is it missing from the plan itself?
4. Is there a `hard_fail_cutoff` for the migration phases? If so, where is it recorded?
5. For the concurrency tests, which script or test harness owns them and at what point in the pipeline do they run?
