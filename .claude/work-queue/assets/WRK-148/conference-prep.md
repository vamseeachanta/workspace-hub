## Decision: Booth vs. Attend-Only

### Recommended: Attend-Only (2026)
At this stage, A&CE has one founder and zero marketing collateral designed for booth conversations. An attend-only pass maximises ROI.

| Factor | Booth | Attend-Only |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Cost | $8,000–$25,000+ (space, build, materials, travel) | $400–$800 (registration + travel) |
| Staff required | 2–3 people minimum | 1 person |
| Lead quality | Broad but shallow (anyone passing by) | High — you choose who you meet |
| A&CE readiness | Not yet (no materials, no website repositioned) | Ready now after WRK-146 completes |
| Recommended year | 2027 if 1+ client signed | 2026 |

**Rationale**: A booth requires website/collateral to be polished (WRK-146), a pipeline strategy already active (outreach tracker), and ideally 1 reference client. None of those exist yet. Attend-only with pre-scheduled meetings is the 2026 play. Budget the $20K difference as runway.
