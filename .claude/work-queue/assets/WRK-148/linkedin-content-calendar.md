# LinkedIn Content Calendar — A&CE (12 Weeks)
> Stream: WRK-148 | Period: Feb 24 – May 16, 2026 | Author: Vamsee Achanta / A&CE

---

## Strategy Overview

**Goal**: Build a recognisable presence with offshore engineering decision-makers before OTC Houston (May 4-7). Each post earns trust with the exact people in the outreach tracker.

**Voice**: Domain expert + practitioner. Not AI hype. Not generic "thought leadership." Specific numbers, specific tools, specific problems solved. The O&G engineering audience has high BS detectors.

**Posting cadence**: 3 posts per week (Mon, Wed, Fri). Consistent beats frequent. Quality beats volume.

**Primary audience**: VP Engineering, Chief Digital Officers, Technical Directors at offshore engineering firms (Subsea7, Wood, Worley, TechnipFMC, DNV, ABS, Oceaneering — exactly the outreach tracker list).

**Secondary audience**: Offshore engineers who use OrcaFlex/AQWA/Abaqus daily — they become internal advocates when decision-makers ask "what do you know about A&CE?"

## KPI Targets

| Metric | Per Post Target | 12-Week Aggregate Target |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Impressions | 500–2,000 (early posts lower) | 50,000+ by Week 12 |
| Reactions | 10–50 | 500+ |
| Comments (meaningful) | 2–10 | 100+ |
| Profile views after post | 20–80 | 800+ |
| New connections from O&G/offshore | 2–5 per week | 60–80 net new |
| DMs / inbound enquiries | 0–1 per week early; 2–3 by Week 8 | 15+ |
| Outreach tracker warm leads from LinkedIn | — | 3–5 contacts pre-qualified via content |

**Key insight**: In O&G professional LinkedIn, 500 impressions from the right 500 people (VPs at Subsea7, DNV, etc.) beats 50,000 from random generalists. Focus on depth of engagement with target audience, not vanity metrics.

## Post Format Guide

| Format | Best For | Production Time | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Text post** | Hot takes, observations, quick insights | 10–15 min | No friction — best for testing hooks |
| **Carousel (PDF)** | Step-by-step breakdowns, numbered lists, case studies | 60–90 min | Highest reach on LinkedIn algorithm currently |
| **Article (LinkedIn)** | Deep technical content, long-form SEO | 2–3 hrs | Evergreen; shareable outside LinkedIn |
| **Native video** | Demo snippets, talking-head commentary | 30–60 min incl edit | Strong algorithm boost; rare in O&G space — stand out |
| **Image + text** | Charts, before/after comparisons, workflow diagrams | 20–30 min | Good for technical visualisations |

## 12-Week Content Calendar

### PHASE 1 — Establish Authority (Weeks 1-4)
*Theme: "This is what we've built." Show the work. Earn credibility before asking for anything.*

---

#### Week 1 (Feb 24–28): The Hook — What A&CE Actually Is
**Objective**: Make the right people stop scrolling and say "wait, how?"

**Mon Feb 24 — Text post: The 4-hour claim**
> Hook: "I ran 50 OrcaFlex configurations in 4 hours. Here's what that usually costs a team."
> Format: Text post (test the hook first, no friction)
> Body: Walk through the problem (manual batch runs, engineer-hours), what A&CE automated, the actual numbers. End with "the engineering hasn't changed — the workflow has."
> CTA: "What's the most repetitive task on your current project?" (drives comments)
> KPI target: 1,000 impressions, 20 reactions, 5 comments

**Wed Feb 26 — Carousel: "5 offshore engineering tasks that AI automates better than a junior engineer"**
> Format: Carousel (5 slides + cover)
> Slides: 1) OrcaFlex batch analysis, 2) Fatigue post-processing, 3) Regulatory-change diff (DNV/API updates), 4) Report generation from model outputs, 5) Parameter sensitivity sweeps
> Each slide: problem → A&CE solution → time saved
> CTA: "Which of these is eating your team's time?"
> KPI target: 2,000 impressions, 40 reactions, 8 comments

**Fri Feb 28 — Text post: The positioning statement**
> Hook: "A&CE isn't an AI company. It's an offshore engineering firm that happens to run at AI speed."
> Body: Brief explanation of the Cognite/Akselos model — domain expertise + software. Why "AI company" is the wrong frame.
> CTA: Tag someone in O&G who would appreciate the distinction
> KPI target: 800 impressions, 15 reactions

---

#### Week 2 (Mar 2–6): The Evidence — Numbers That Mean Something to Engineers
**Objective**: Back the Week 1 claims with concrete proof. Engineers trust data, not narrative.

**Mon Mar 2 — Image post: The 221 S-N curve chart**
> Hook: "221 S-N fatigue curves. 17 international standards. One Python library."
> Format: Image showing a sample S-N curve chart from the library + text post
> Body: What S-N curves are, why manually cross-referencing 17 standards is painful, what A&CE automated, where to find it (GitHub link when open-source package is live)
> CTA: "Are you still looking up S-N data manually in the appendices?"
> KPI target: 1,500 impressions, 25 reactions, 6 comments (high engagement from technical audience)

**Wed Mar 4 — Carousel: "From 3 days to 4 hours — one workflow transformation"**
> Format: Carousel (6 slides)
> Content: Walk through a real project type (e.g., riser fatigue analysis batch run). Before: 3 engineers, 3 days. After: 1 A&CE automation script, 4 hours. Show the actual delta in hours and cost at day-rate.
> No client names — describe the problem type generically
> CTA: "What does 3 engineer-days cost your firm?"
> KPI target: 2,500 impressions, 50 reactions, 10 comments

**Fri Mar 6 — Text post: The offshore hiring problem**
> Hook: "Subsea7, Wood, Worley — they're all hiring for roles that A&CE already fills. That's not a coincidence."
> Body: Observe the pattern in job ads (engineering analytics, digital tools, automation) without naming specific job postings. Make the case that the skills gap is real and A&CE is the wedge.
> CTA: "Are you hiring for these roles? I'd be curious what's driving it."
> KPI target: 1,200 impressions, 20 reactions — intentionally invites VP-level comments

---

#### Week 3 (Mar 9–13): The Problem Space — Give Their Pain a Name
**Objective**: Make target decision-makers feel seen. "This person understands our world."

**Mon Mar 9 — Text post: The regulatory update paradox**
> Hook: "Every time DNV updates RP-C203, somewhere a team of engineers manually updates 400 analysis configs. Nobody talks about this."
> Body: Describe the hidden cost of regulatory change management in offshore structural engineering. The diff between standards versions, the manual update process, the error risk.
> CTA: "How does your firm handle major standard updates?"
> KPI target: 1,500 impressions, 30 reactions, 15 comments (this one should resonate)

**Wed Mar 11 — Article (LinkedIn): "The Hidden Engineering Debt in Offshore Project Delivery"**
> Format: LinkedIn article (long-form, evergreen)
> Content: Deep dive on manual workflow debt — the accumulated cost of batch analysis scripts that break, one-off Excel models, report templates that need manual updating every project. Give this problem a name: "engineering workflow debt."
> 800–1,200 words. Include specific toolchain references (OrcaFlex, AQWA, Abaqus, Python).
> CTA: Link back to aceengineer.com case studies page
> KPI target: 2,000 impressions, 30 reactions, 10 comments, 5 saves

**Fri Mar 13 — Text post: The 10x engineer myth**
> Hook: "The 10x engineer myth is wrong. The right frame is: 1 expert + the right tooling = the output of 10 engineers."
> Body: Connect to A&CE's reality. Not exaggerating human capability — systematising the expert's knowledge into repeatable tools.
> KPI target: 1,000 impressions, 25 reactions

---

#### Week 4 (Mar 16–20): The Firm — What A&CE Is Building
**Objective**: Transition from "individual expert" to "firm with a system." Plant the seed for retainer conversations.

**Mon Mar 16 — Carousel: "How A&CE is structured (not a freelancer)"**
> Format: Carousel (4 slides)
> Slides: 1) The firm model (not contracting, retainer-based), 2) The AI orchestration layer (Claude Code as orchestrator, specialist agents), 3) The 704-module library (what "institutional knowledge as code" looks like), 4) What a retainer engagement looks like
> CTA: "If this model would help your team, DM me."
> KPI target: 3,000 impressions, 60 reactions, 12 comments

**Wed Mar 18 — Text post: The acqui-hire question**
> Hook: "Is A&CE building to sell? Honest answer."
> Body: Acknowledge the question. Explain the Cognite/Akselos model — firms with engineering IP are acquired, not individuals. The goal is to build something worth acquiring, not to exit early.
> KPI target: 1,500 impressions, 35 reactions

**Fri Mar 20 — Text post: OTC Houston teaser**
> Hook: "I'll be at OTC Houston May 4-7. If you're attending and work in offshore structural engineering, let's meet."
> Body: Brief description of what A&CE will be doing at OTC. 6 meetings target.
> CTA: "Comment or DM if you'll be there and want to connect."
> KPI target: 800 impressions, 20 reactions, 5 comments (each comment = qualified lead)

---

### PHASE 2 — Build Engagement (Weeks 5-8)
*Theme: "Join the conversation." Invite dialogue, build relationships with the audience earned in Phase 1.*

---

#### Week 5 (Mar 23–27): Audience Questions
**Mon Mar 23 — Text post: Survey / question post**
> "Quick poll for offshore engineers: what's the most painful part of your analysis workflow? A) Running the analysis B) Post-processing results C) Writing the report D) Updating for standard changes"
> Note: LinkedIn polls get strong engagement. Use results as content fodder for next week.

**Wed Mar 25 — Carousel: AI tools that actually work in O&G (and ones that don't)**
> Practical guide to AI tooling for engineering teams. Honest assessment. Builds trust by acknowledging limitations.

## Engagement Tactics — O&G Audience Specific

### What works in this audience
- **Specific numbers**: "50 OrcaFlex configurations" beats "offshore analysis automation"
- **Tool names**: Mentioning OrcaFlex, AQWA, Abaqus, DNV RP-C203, ISO 19902 signals insider knowledge — the right people recognise them immediately
- **Anti-hype framing**: "This is not magic — here's the actual workflow" builds more trust than AI superlatives
- **Problems, not products**: Lead with the pain (3 days of manual batch runs) before the solution
- **Honest limitations**: Posts that acknowledge what A&CE doesn't do yet outperform pure promotional posts

### What does not work in this audience
- Generic "AI transformation" language without specifics
- Jargon borrowed from tech/SaaS (PLG, ARR, growth hacking) — this audience rejects it
- Frequent CTAs to "sign up" or "book a demo" — build relationship first
- Posting about AI trends without anchoring to offshore engineering specifics

### Comment engagement rules
- Reply to every comment within 24 hours
- When a Tier 1/2 company employee comments, visit their profile and send a connection request
- Tag people by name in replies when appropriate — increases reach
- Ask a follow-up question in replies to extend conversations

### Hashtags (use 3-5 per post)
**Primary (always use)**: #offshoreengineering #subseatechnology #energytech
**Rotate in**: #oilandgas #marinengineering #structuralengineering #digitaltransformation #AIengineering #OrcaFlex #fatigue

## Content Production Workflow

1. **Plan (Mon morning)**: Review calendar, confirm week's 3 topics, note any news hooks (standard updates, industry news, OTC announcements)
2. **Draft (30–60 min per post)**: Write text-first, then add visuals if carousel/image format
3. **Review**: Read aloud once. If it sounds like marketing copy, rewrite in plain language.
4. **Schedule**: Post Mon 8am, Wed 12pm, Fri 4pm (UK/US overlap maximises reach)
5. **Engage (30 min per post)**: Reply to comments within first 2 hours for algorithm boost

## Monthly Review Checkpoints

| Date | Review Action |
|------|--------------|
| Mar 20 | Month 1 review: which posts drove profile views + connection requests from target companies? Adjust Phase 2 topics accordingly. |
| Apr 17 | Month 2 review: OTC meeting conversion rate from LinkedIn content (how many meetings came from warm LinkedIn contacts vs cold). |
| May 15 | Month 3 review (post-OTC): full pipeline attribution — how many tracker prospects first engaged via LinkedIn content? |

---

*Content calendar is a living document. Update weekly with what worked and what to drop. The best signal: when someone at Subsea7/Wood/DNV comments or DMs, note which post triggered it.*
