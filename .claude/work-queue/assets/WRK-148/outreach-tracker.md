## Tier 1 — Offshore Engineering Consultancies
*Fit: Highest. These firms employ the exact engineers who use OrcaFlex/AQWA/Abaqus daily. Pain point: manual batch runs, report generation, regulatory-change tracking.*

| # | Company | Fit Score | Key Contact | Role | LinkedIn | Status | Last Action | Notes |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|------|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **Subsea7** | 5/5 | TBD — search hiring mgr for digital/AI roles | VP Engineering / Digital Lead | research needed | `not_started` | — | "Literally hiring for what A&CE already has" — validate via job board. Target engineering analytics team. |
| 2 | **Wood plc** | 5/5 | Laura Leonard | VP Digital Solutions | https://linkedin.com/in/search: "Laura Leonard Wood" | `not_started` | — | Priority contact from action matrix (Week 1). Digital transformation mandate public. |
| 3 | **Worley** | 5/5 | Laura Leonard (confirm match) | Digital / AI leadership | research needed | `not_started` | — | HIGH/This week per action matrix. Overlap with Wood contact — confirm correct firm before outreach. |
| 4 | **TechnipFMC** | 4/5 | TBD | VP Engineering Analytics | research needed | `not_started` | — | Strong FMC-style engineering culture. Look for digital innovation or data science lead. |
| 5 | **2H Offshore** | 5/5 | TBD | Principal / Technical Director | research needed | `not_started` | — | MEDIUM/This month per action matrix. Specialist riser/mooring firm — niche fit is very high. Small firm = faster decision. |
| 6 | **McDermott** | 4/5 | TBD | VP Engineering or Chief Digital Officer | research needed | `not_started` | — | Coming out of restructuring — lean on digital efficiency angle ("do more with fewer headcount"). |
| 7 | **Saipem** | 3/5 | TBD | Engineering Analytics / Digital | research needed | `not_started` | — | Italian parent, slower procurement. Approach via LinkedIn thought leadership first before cold outreach. Check aceengineer-admin for any existing Saipem relationship. |

---

## Tier 2 — Classification Bodies & Digital Platforms
*Fit: High. Classification bodies are adopting AI for rule interpretation and design checking. Digital platforms are potential acquirers or integration partners.*

| # | Company | Fit Score | Key Contact | Role | LinkedIn | Status | Last Action | Notes |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|------|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 8 | **DNV Digital Solutions** | 5/5 | TBD | Product Manager, SESAM/Nauticus | research needed | `not_started` | — | Best Tier 2 fit. SESAM is the dominant FEA software for offshore — A&CE's automation layer is a natural extension. Explore partnership before services. |
| 9 | **ABS (American Bureau of Shipping)** | 4/5 | Patrick Ryan | Director (Digital/Innovation) | research needed | `contacted` | Feb 16: cold email drafted in GTM strategy doc | MEDIUM/This month per action matrix. Follow up if no reply by Mar 7. |
| 10 | **Bureau Veritas** | 3/5 | TBD | Digital / Innovation Lead | research needed | `not_started` | — | Lower fit than DNV/ABS. Approach after Tier 1 & higher Tier 2 contacts. |
| 11 | **Akselos** | 5/5 | Thomas Leurent | CEO / Co-founder | research needed | `not_started` | — | HIGH/This week per action matrix. Structural reduced-order modeling firm — complementary to A&CE. Could be partner, acquirer, or reference client. |
| 12 | **Cognite** | 4/5 | TBD | BD or Partnerships | research needed | `not_started` | — | Industrial data platform. Not a direct client — potential partnership/integration angle. Reach out to BD/partnerships team, not engineering. |

---

## Tier 3 — Offshore Wind Developers
*Fit: Moderate-High for structural analytics, lower for process automation. Approach with wind-specific framing (fatigue, monopile design, cable routing).*

| # | Company | Fit Score | Key Contact | Role | LinkedIn | Status | Last Action | Notes |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|------|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 13 | **Orsted** | 4/5 | TBD | Head of Structural Engineering / Digital | research needed | `not_started` | — | Largest offshore wind developer. WindEurope 2026 (Apr 21-23) is the natural conference touchpoint. |
| 14 | **Equinor** | 4/5 | TBD | Ventures / Digital Engineering | research needed | `not_started` | — | Dual-track: engineering client AND venture arm (Equinor Ventures). Map both tracks separately. |
| 15 | **Dominion CVOW** | 3/5 | TBD | VP Engineering | research needed | `not_started` | — | Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. Lower fit score — pursue only after Tier 1-2 traction established. |

---

## Tier 4 — Oil Majors (Acqui-hire / Venture Track)
*Fit: Moderate as services clients; HIGH as venture or acqui-hire targets. Lead with ventures/corporate development contacts, not engineering procurement.*

| # | Company | Fit Score | Key Contact | Role | LinkedIn | Status | Last Action | Notes |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|------|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 16 | **Shell** | 3/5 | TBD | Shell Ventures / Shell GameChanger | research needed | `not_started` | — | Shell GameChanger program is the right entry. Also Shell Ventures for investment conversation. Engineering services procurement is slow/painful — avoid direct services track. |
| 17 | **Chevron** | 3/5 | TBD | Chevron Technology Ventures | research needed | `not_started` | — | CTV (Chevron Technology Ventures) funds early-stage companies with O&G applications. Validate fit via their stated investment thesis. |
| 18 | **BP** | 3/5 | TBD | BP Ventures / BP Digital | research needed | `not_started` | — | BP Launchpad + BP Ventures. Similar playbook to Shell/Chevron. Approach ventures track, not procurement. |

---

## Tier 5 — Specialist Niche (High Probability)
*Fit: High. Smaller firms, faster procurement cycles, acute pain with manual engineering workflows.*

| # | Company | Fit Score | Key Contact | Role | LinkedIn | Status | Last Action | Notes |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|------|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 19 | **Oceaneering** | 4/5 | TBD | VP Engineering / Digital | research needed | `not_started` | — | MEDIUM/This month per action matrix. ROV and marine services — moderate FEA automation fit. Check OTC Houston attendance for in-person meeting. |
| 20 | **Intecsea/Worley** | 4/5 | TBD | Technical Director | research needed | `not_started` | — | Specialist pipeline/riser engineering firm within Worley group. Very high technical fit. Can approach as part of broader Worley outreach. |

## Outreach Message Templates (Quick Reference)

### LinkedIn Connection Note — VP Engineering Variant
> "Hi [Name] — I run A&CE, a small firm that automates the manual grind in offshore structural analysis (OrcaFlex batch runs, fatigue reporting, regulatory change tracking). Your work at [Company] caught my attention. Happy to connect."

### LinkedIn Connection Note — Digital Leader Variant
> "Hi [Name] — connecting because A&CE sits at the intersection of offshore engineering domain expertise and AI-native tooling. We help mid-market offshore firms do in days what traditionally takes weeks. Would value being in your network."

### LinkedIn Connection Note — Akselos/Cognite Variant (Peer/Partner)
> "Hi [Name] — A&CE does for offshore structural analysis workflows what Akselos does for simulation speed. Thought it might be worth connecting — either as peers, partners, or just good mutual contacts in the space."

### Cold Email Subject Lines (rotate these)
- "One-person firm, team-scale output — offshore structural automation"
- "Automating what your engineers hate doing most"
- "A&CE — AI-native offshore engineering analytics (5-min read)"
