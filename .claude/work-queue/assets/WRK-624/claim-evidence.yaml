        verdict: MINOR
    combined_verdict: REQUEST_CHANGES with Codex/Gemini support
    fallback: NO_OUTPUT rerun not required because valid artifacts exist

    test_manifest: assets/WRK-624/variation-test-results.md
    summary: variation tests and queue-validate script confirm schema and routing fields

    result: pass
    notes: repo-local doc review only
