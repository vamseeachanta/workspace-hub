# BSEE Field Economics Case Study — Rebuild on Calibrated Cost Data

## What

Rebuild the BSEE field economics case study (originally WRK-078/WRK-153) using calibrated drilling/completion cost data from WRK-019 and cost calibration from WRK-171. The result will be substantially more credible than proxy-based estimates.

## Why

The original case study used proxy costs; with WRK-019 and WRK-171 complete, the same analysis can use real calibrated cost data — a step change in credibility for client presentations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Case study rebuilt with WRK-019 cost layer
- [ ] NPV/IRR recalculated with calibrated costs
- [ ] Published on aceengineer website
- [ ] Clearly shows data provenance (real BSEE + calibrated costs)

## Agentic AI Horizon

**Disposition: blocked** — do not start until WRK-019 and WRK-171 are both complete; result will be far more credible and won't need to be redone
