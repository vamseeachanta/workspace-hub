# Brazil ANP Production Data Module

## Why High Priority

ANP is the only open upstream data source outside the US and NW Europe that
offers **well-level monthly production** (oil, gas, water) as free bulk CSV
downloads — the same granularity as BSEE for GoM. Brazil is also the single
largest source of non-OPEC supply growth: ~5.1 million boe/d in 2025, driven
by pre-salt Santos and Campos Basin FPSOs (Búzios, Lula, Mero, Sépia).
Búzios alone (~800,000 bopd plateau) is the largest deepwater field under
development globally. Without ANP data, worldenergydata has a critical blind spot.

## Data Source

**Portal:** `https://www.gov.br/anp/pt-br/centrais-de-conteudo/dados-abertos`
**Query tool:** `https://cdp.anp.gov.br/ords/r/cdp_apex/consulta-dados-publicos-cdp/consulta-producao-por-poco`
**National open data:** `https://dados.gov.br/dados/conjuntos-dados/producao-de-petroleo-e-gas-natural-por-poco`

- Well-level monthly oil and gas production CSV per semester/year
- Filter by: basin, state, field, well, operator, onshore/offshore
- Consistent schema across all years (machine-ingestible)
- Update lag: ~6-8 weeks after month-end
- Free, no registration for bulk CSV downloads
- Historical data back to 1994

## Key Fields of Interest (Pre-salt Santos / Campos Basin)

| Field | Operator | Basin | Type | Peak rate |
|-------|----------|-------|------|-----------|
| Búzios | Petrobras (72.5%) | Santos | Pre-salt FPSO complex | ~800,000 bopd (plateau) |
| Lula | Petrobras (65%) | Santos | Pre-salt FPSO | ~250,000 bopd |
| Mero | Petrobras (38.6%) | Santos | Pre-salt FPSO | ~180,000 bopd |
| Sépia | Petrobras (45%) | Santos | Pre-salt FPSO | ~180,000 bopd |
| Marlim / Marlim Sul | Petrobras | Campos | Post-salt, mature | Declining |
| Roncador | Petrobras | Campos | Semi/FPSO | ~100,000 bopd |

## Brazil Fiscal Regime (distinct from BSEE/NCS/UKCS)

Two parallel regimes apply:

| Regime | Fields | Key terms |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Concession | Post-salt (Campos, pre-2010 Santos) | Royalties 5-15%, CSLL + IRPJ corporate tax (~34% effective), Special Participation (progressive SP on large fields) |
| Production Sharing (PSA) | Pre-salt (Búzios, Lula, Mero, Sépia, etc.) | Profit oil split to government + Petrobras minimum 30% participation, royalties 15%, no Special Participation |

Economics module must model both regimes. The PSA regime (pre-salt) differs
fundamentally from the NCS / UKCS concession systems — government takes via
profit oil split rather than tax, which changes the NPV/IRR shape significantly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ANP bulk CSV downloader with semester/year parameterisation and local cache
- [ ] LFS stub handling for large historical files
- [ ] Well-level production loader (oil, gas, water, condensate in Sm³ + bbl conversion)
- [ ] Field-level aggregation from well records (wells → field mapping via ANP dataset)
- [ ] Decline curve fitting for 3+ fields (Lula, Búzios, Marlim for mature comparison)
- [ ] Concession and PSA fiscal regime models in field_economics.py
- [ ] 30+ tests (unit + integration with cached data)
- [ ] Cross-validation: compare ANP aggregates against ANP Statistical Yearbook 2025

## Notes

- ANP data uses metric units (Sm³/day for oil/gas) — convert to bbl/d for
  cross-basin comparisons
- Field name encoding: Portuguese diacritics in CSV headers; handle encoding explicitly
- CSV schema is consistent but confirm column names haven't shifted since 2020
- Pattern to follow: BSEE loader (WRK-019) for structure; NCS loader (WRK-190) for units handling
