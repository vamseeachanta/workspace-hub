# Add root pyproject.toml to workspace-hub src/

## What
Add a `pyproject.toml` at workspace-hub root that declares the `workspace_hub` package
from `src/`. Currently `src/` contains a Python package (`workspace_hub`) with no
governing project file, making installation and tooling (pytest, mypy, ruff) unclear.

## Why
Tier-1 consistency review (2026-02-23): workspace-hub root has no pyproject.toml
while `coordination/` has its own. This means `src/workspace_hub/` is essentially
an orphaned package — agents and devs don't know how to install or test it.

## Scope
- Create `pyproject.toml` at workspace-hub root declaring `workspace_hub` package
- Ensure `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` points to `tests/`
- Ensure `[tool.setuptools.packages.find] where = ["src"]`
- Update `workspace-structure.md` to document the boundary between:
  - `coordination/` (standalone subproject, own pyproject.toml)
  - `src/workspace_hub/` (hub implementation, governed by root pyproject.toml)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` at workspace-hub root present
- [ ] `pip install -e .` installs `workspace_hub` package
- [ ] `workspace-structure.md` updated to clarify src/ vs coordination/ boundary
- [ ] `uv run pytest` resolves against root pyproject

## Notes
- Do NOT fold coordination/ into root pyproject — it has independent tests and isolation
- Root pyproject should list coordination as a dev dependency if needed
