# Install Semantic Scholar MCP Server for Agent Literature Search

## What

Install and configure the Semantic Scholar MCP server to enable direct
paper search (200M+ papers, OA filter) from within Claude Code agent
workflows.

## Why

Agents currently have no direct path to engineering literature during task
execution. This MCP server enables topic/year/field-of-study search without
leaving the agent context — a zero-code capability unlock.

## Deliverables

- MCP server installed and configured in `.claude/settings.json`
- Version-pinned with trust assessment documented
- Usage examples in a skill or doc

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP server installed and responding to queries
- [ ] Version pinned to specific commit/release
- [ ] Trust assessment documented (source review, permissions, sandbox)
- [ ] Least-privilege permissions configured
- [ ] Test query returns relevant engineering papers
- [ ] Usage documented in `.claude/docs/` or skill
