# MPD Systems Knowledge Module — Pressure Management for Drillships

## Context

Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) is no longer emerging technology — it's becoming standard equipment on new-build drillships. Operators require it. Wells that were previously undrillable are now possible because of MPD. Every new drillship coming out is being fitted with MPD systems.

The adoption curve mirrors Cyberbase in the mid-2000s: not an overnight shift, but rigs without MPD capability are becoming less competitive and less employable over time. The market is moving, and A&CE needs domain coverage here.

**Domain immersion**: 4-day MPD training on Safekick system (Valaris DS-12 simulator), Feb 2026. ADs, Drillers, Senior Toolpushers, OIMs, Client Reps all training on the same system together. This is in-house training for what's running on the DS-12.

## What

Build a knowledge module covering MPD systems, configurations, and their integration with drillship operations. Two parts:

### Part 1 — MPD System Data Model (worldenergydata)

Structured data capturing MPD system specifications across the active fleet:

```python
class MPDSystemEntry:
    system_name: str                    # e.g., "Safekick", "EC-Drill", "Microflux"
    manufacturer: str                   # e.g., "Safekick AS", "SLB", "Halliburton"
    system_type: str                    # "closed-loop", "pressurized mud cap", "dual gradient"
    rig_name: str | None                # rig it's installed on
    rig_type: str | None                # drillship, semi-sub, jack-up
    pressure_rating_psi: float | None
    flow_rate_capacity_gpm: float | None
    choke_type: str | None              # "automated", "manual", "hybrid"
    backpressure_capability: bool       # can apply surface backpressure
    rotating_control_device: str | None # RCD model/manufacturer
    integration_level: str | None       # "fully automated", "semi-automated", "advisory"
    year_installed: int | None
```

### Part 2 — MPD Technical Reference (digitalmodel)

Engineering reference content for MPD analysis and well planning:

1. **MPD configurations taxonomy** — closed-loop (CBHP), pressurized mud cap (PMCD), dual gradient, returns flow control (RFC)
2. **Pressure window management** — pore pressure, fracture gradient, ECD management, narrow-margin drilling
3. **Equipment integration** — how MPD interfaces with BOP, riser, mud system, choke manifold on a drillship
4. **Operational scenarios** — connections (pump-off/pump-on pressure management), kicks, ballooning, losses
5. **MPD vs conventional** — decision framework: when MPD is required, beneficial, or unnecessary

### Part 3 — Fleet MPD Capability Flag (worldenergydata)

Add MPD fields to `DrillingRigEntry` model (see separate enhancement below) and populate from contractor configurations where known.

## Why

- **GTM positioning**: MPD capability assessment is a consulting deliverable. Operators choosing rigs need to evaluate MPD systems — A&CE can provide structured comparison data.
- **Riser analysis connection**: MPD changes the annular pressure profile, affecting riser loading (WRK-046). The riser parametric analysis should include MPD loading cases.
- **Risk framework integration**: MPD is a strategic risk mitigation technology. WRK-163's risk framework should recognize MPD as a rig capability that changes what risks are manageable at the operational tier.
- **Well planning**: WRK-164 (production test quality) and pressure management share physics — ECD, pressure gradients, flow dynamics.
- **Market reality**: "If your rig isn't running it, you're going to get left behind."

## Key MPD Systems to Cover

| System | Manufacturer | Type | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------|-------|
| Safekick | Safekick AS (NOV) | Closed-loop CBHP | Running on Valaris DS-12, widely adopted on drillships |
| EC-Drill | SLB | Closed-loop CBHP | Large SLB installed base |
| Microflux | Halliburton | Closed-loop with early kick detection | Strong kick detection capability |
| OneSubsea MPD | OneSubsea/SLB | Subsea MPD | Subsea rotating control device |
| AFGlobal | AFGlobal | RCD + choke | Equipment supplier, integration varies |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MPDSystemEntry data model defined and tested
- [ ] MPD fields added to DrillingRigEntry (mpd_capable, mpd_system, mpd_manufacturer)
- [ ] MPD configuration taxonomy document (4 main types with decision tree)
- [ ] Pressure window management reference (pore pressure / fracture gradient / ECD)
- [ ] Equipment integration reference (BOP, riser, choke manifold, RCD)
- [ ] At least 3 contractor fleet configs updated with known MPD data (Valaris, Transocean, Noble)
- [ ] Tests for data model, loading, and fleet queries ("list all MPD-capable drillships")
- [ ] Connection points documented for WRK-046 (riser loading) and WRK-163 (risk framework)

## Post-Training Capture Plan

After the Houston Safekick training (Feb 2026), capture:
- Safekick system architecture and operating modes
- Simulator scenarios and lessons learned
- Pressure control sequences during connections
- Kick response procedures under MPD vs conventional
- Integration specifics for DS-12 configuration
