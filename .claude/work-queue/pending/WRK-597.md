# Geotechnical Module — Umbrella Tracker

## What

Umbrella tracker for the geotechnical engineering module in
`digitalmodel/src/digitalmodel/geotechnical/`. This WRK is complete when
all 6 children complete.

## Why

Geotechnical analysis is fundamental to every offshore structure — jackets,
monopiles, gravity bases, suction caissons, drag anchors, and pipeline
on-bottom stability all require soil-structure interaction calculations.
No geotechnical module currently exists in the ecosystem. This fills a
critical gap between the structural modules (WRK-383) and the mooring
modules (WRK-474).

Original WRK-597 was too large for a single item. Split into 6 phased
children per review feedback.

## Children (Dependency Graph)

```
WRK-618 (Soil Models)  ← foundation layer, no blockers
    ├── WRK-619 (Piles)              ← depends on 618
    ├── WRK-620 (On-Bottom Stability) ← depends on 618
    ├── WRK-621 (Foundations)         ← depends on 618
    ├── WRK-623 (Scour)              ← depends on 618
    └── WRK-622 (Anchors)            ← depends on 618 + 619
```

| WRK | Phase | Title | Blocked By |
|-----|-------|-------|------------|
| WRK-618 | 1 | Soil models, CPT correlation, shared types | — |
| WRK-619 | 2 | Pile axial/lateral capacity, p-y/t-z/q-z | WRK-618 |
| WRK-620 | 3 | Pipeline on-bottom stability (DNV-RP-F109) | WRK-618 |
| WRK-621 | 4 | Shallow foundation bearing capacity | WRK-618 |
| WRK-622 | 5 | Anchor capacity (drag, suction, torpedo) | WRK-618, WRK-619 |
| WRK-623 | 6 | Scour prediction (DNV-RP-F107) | WRK-618 |

Phases 2–4 and 6 are parallelisable after Phase 1. Phase 5 needs Phase 2
(suction caisson reuses pile lateral methods).

## Key Standards

- API RP 2GEO (Geotechnical and Foundation Design Considerations)
- DNV-RP-C212 (Offshore Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering)
- DNV-RP-E303 (Geotechnical Design and Installation of Suction Anchors)
- DNV-RP-F109 (On-Bottom Stability Design of Submarine Pipelines)
- DNV-RP-F107 (Risk Assessment of Pipeline Protection)
- ISO 19901-4 (Geotechnical and Foundation Design Considerations)
- API RP 2SK (Station Keeping — mooring anchor sections)
- DNVGL-RP-E301 (Design and Installation of Fluke Anchors)

## Package Adoption

| Package | License | Strategy | Phase |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| pygef | MIT | Direct dependency | 1 |
| python-AGS4 | LGPL-3.0 | Direct dependency | 1 |
| groundhog | GPL-3.0 | Optional extra only | 2, 4 |
| openpile | GPL-3.0 | Optional extra only | 2 |

## Deferred Topics

| Topic | Reason | Suggested WRK |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Settlement (elastic, consolidation) | Needs Phase 1+4 first | WRK-624 |
| Slope stability | Specialist sub-discipline | WRK-625 |
| ISO 19901-2 (Seismic design) | Separate domain | separate WRK |

## Integration Points

- **WRK-474** (MoorDyn/MoorPy): anchor holding capacity feeds mooring design
- **WRK-478** (Cathodic Protection): anode sled OBS checks
- **WRK-481** (GEBCO Bathymetry): water depth and seabed slope
- **WRK-582** (OpenGeoSys): advanced soil-structure interaction (future)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 6 children (WRK-618..623) complete
- [ ] Cross-review passes (Codex hard gate)
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Source

Identified as a gap during WRK-391 research and WRK-383 module mapping.
Split into phased children per review feedback (2026-02-26).
