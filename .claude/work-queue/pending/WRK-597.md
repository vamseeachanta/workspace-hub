# Geotechnical Module — Foundations, Piles, Mooring Anchors, On-Bottom Stability

## What

Create a geotechnical engineering module in `digitalmodel/geotechnical/`
covering offshore foundation design, pile capacity, mooring anchor holding
capacity, and on-bottom stability assessment for pipelines and subsea
structures.

## Why

Geotechnical analysis is fundamental to every offshore structure — jackets,
monopiles, gravity bases, suction caissons, drag anchors, and pipeline
on-bottom stability all require soil-structure interaction calculations.
No geotechnical module currently exists in the ecosystem. This fills a
critical gap between the structural modules (WRK-383) and the mooring
modules (WRK-474).

## Scope

### Sub-modules

1. **foundations/** — shallow foundations (gravity base, mudmat) bearing
   capacity per DNV-RP-C212, ISO 19901-4
2. **piles/** — axial and lateral pile capacity (API RP 2GEO, DNV-RP-C212),
   t-z/p-y/q-z curves, pile driving analysis (wave equation)
3. **anchors/** — drag anchor holding capacity, suction caisson capacity
   (DNV-RP-E303, API RP 2SK), torpedo/SEPLA anchor capacity
4. **on_bottom_stability/** — pipeline lateral stability per DNV-RP-F109,
   absolute stability and generalized methods, soil resistance models
5. **soil_models/** — undrained shear strength profiles, CPT correlation
   (Robertson), cyclic degradation, consolidation

### Key Standards

- API RP 2GEO (Geotechnical and Foundation Design Considerations)
- DNV-RP-C212 (Offshore Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering)
- DNV-RP-E303 (Geotechnical Design and Installation of Suction Anchors)
- DNV-RP-F109 (On-Bottom Stability Design of Submarine Pipelines)
- ISO 19901-4 (Geotechnical and Foundation Design Considerations)
- API RP 2SK (Station Keeping — mooring anchor sections)
- DNVGL-RP-E301 (Design and Installation of Fluke Anchors)

### Open-Source Resources

- `pygef` — CPT/borehole data parsing (Dutch Geotechnical Society format)
- `groundhog` — geotechnical calculation library (pile capacity, bearing)
- `openpile` — open-source pile analysis (p-y, t-z curves)
- `pyslope` — slope stability analysis
- `OpenGeoSys` — advanced THMC coupling (see WRK-582)

## Deliverables

- Module structure at `digitalmodel/src/digitalmodel/geotechnical/`
- Core calculations: bearing capacity, pile axial/lateral, anchor capacity,
  pipeline on-bottom stability
- Soil profile data model (layered soil, CPT-based)
- Test suite with validation against published examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Module structure created with 5 sub-modules
- [ ] Shallow foundation bearing capacity (undrained + drained)
- [ ] Pile axial capacity (API RP 2GEO method) with t-z curves
- [ ] Pile lateral capacity with p-y curves (soft clay, stiff clay, sand)
- [ ] Drag anchor holding capacity calculation
- [ ] Suction caisson capacity (vertical, horizontal, inclined)
- [ ] Pipeline on-bottom stability per DNV-RP-F109 (absolute method)
- [ ] Soil profile data model with CPT correlation
- [ ] Tests validated against at least 2 published worked examples per
      sub-module
- [ ] Cross-review passes (Codex hard gate)
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Integration Points

- **WRK-474** (MoorDyn/MoorPy): anchor holding capacity feeds into mooring
  system design — anchor capacity limits the mooring line tension
- **WRK-478** (Cathodic Protection): anode sled foundations require
  on-bottom stability checks
- **WRK-481** (GEBCO Bathymetry): water depth and seabed slope for
  foundation and stability assessments
- **WRK-582** (OpenGeoSys): advanced soil-structure interaction for complex
  geometries (future extension)

## Source

Identified as a gap during WRK-391 research and WRK-383 module mapping.
Adjacent to existing structural, subsea, and mooring modules.
