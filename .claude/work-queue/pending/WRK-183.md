# WRK-183: Domain Knowledge Graph

## What
Build a knowledge graph linking engineering concepts (hull form → displacement → stability → mooring loads → fatigue). Use graph to auto-suggest relevant skills and memory when entering a domain area. Currently skill discovery is flat text search — a graph enables transitive discovery.

## SME Discussion Required
- **Naval Architecture**: Core concept taxonomy — what are the 50-100 key nodes?
- **Structural Engineering**: How do design codes relate to engineering concepts in the graph?
- **Metocean**: How do environmental conditions (wave, wind, current) connect to structural response?
- **All**: Should the graph be static (curated YAML) or dynamic (built from session patterns)?

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Define concept taxonomy (YAML) — ~100 nodes, ~300 edges
- [ ] Phase 2: Build graph data structure and query engine (Python, networkx or lightweight)
- [ ] Phase 3: Integrate with session start — suggest skills based on graph neighbors
- [ ] Phase 4: Integrate with /improve — auto-discover knowledge gaps from graph analysis
- [ ] Phase 5: Visualize graph (Mermaid or D3.js HTML report)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- A domain knowledge graph linking engineering concepts enables transitive skill discovery — significantly boosts agent quality on complex multi-domain tasks.
- Knowledge graph construction will benefit from improved reasoning models; but the domain ontology (what connects to what) requires engineering domain expertise to define.
- **Disposition: groundwork now, park rest** — define the ontology schema and key concept relationships now; defer automated graph population to when better models can traverse engineering literature to fill the graph.
