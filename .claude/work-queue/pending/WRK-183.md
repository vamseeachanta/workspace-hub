# WRK-183: Domain Knowledge Graph

## What
Build a knowledge graph linking engineering concepts (hull form → displacement → stability → mooring loads → fatigue). Use graph to auto-suggest relevant skills and memory when entering a domain area. Currently skill discovery is flat text search — a graph enables transitive discovery.

## SME Discussion Required
- **Naval Architecture**: Core concept taxonomy — what are the 50-100 key nodes?
- **Structural Engineering**: How do design codes relate to engineering concepts in the graph?
- **Metocean**: How do environmental conditions (wave, wind, current) connect to structural response?
- **All**: Should the graph be static (curated YAML) or dynamic (built from session patterns)?

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Define concept taxonomy (YAML) — 88 nodes, 137 edges across 10 domains
- [x] Phase 2: Build graph data structure and query engine (Python, networkx)
- [x] Phase 3: Integrate with session start — SessionAdvisor suggests skills via graph traversal
- [ ] Phase 4: Integrate with /improve — auto-discover knowledge gaps from graph analysis
- [x] Phase 5: Visualize graph (Mermaid HTML report — reports/knowledge-graph-wrk183.html)

## Implementation Notes (2026-02-24)

Phases 1, 2, 3, and 5 implemented and tested.  All 46 TDD tests pass.  Legal scan: PASS.

### Files created
- `src/knowledge_graph/__init__.py` — package entry point
- `src/knowledge_graph/graph_engine.py` — KnowledgeGraph, GraphNode, GraphEdge, SkillSuggestion
- `src/knowledge_graph/taxonomy_loader.py` — YAML taxonomy → KnowledgeGraph
- `src/knowledge_graph/session_advisor.py` — transitive skill suggestion with hop-decay scoring
- `src/knowledge_graph/visualizer.py` — Mermaid diagram + HTML report generation
- `src/knowledge_graph/data/engineering-taxonomy.yaml` — 88 nodes, 137 edges, 10 domains
- `tests/unit/test_knowledge_graph.py` — 46 TDD tests (all passing)
- `reports/knowledge-graph-wrk183.html` — rendered Mermaid graph report

### Taxonomy coverage
Domains: naval_architecture, structural_engineering, metocean, hydrodynamics, geotechnical,
production_engineering, riser_engineering, mooring_engineering, fatigue_assessment,
inspection_maintenance.

Key chain verified by test: hull_form → displacement → stability → mooring_loads → fatigue

### Deferred (per disposition)
Phase 4 (/improve integration) deferred until better reasoning models can traverse
engineering literature for automated graph population.

## Agentic AI Horizon

- A domain knowledge graph linking engineering concepts enables transitive skill discovery — significantly boosts agent quality on complex multi-domain tasks.
- Knowledge graph construction will benefit from improved reasoning models; but the domain ontology (what connects to what) requires engineering domain expertise to define.
- **Disposition: groundwork now, park rest** — define the ontology schema and key concept relationships now; defer automated graph population to when better models can traverse engineering literature to fill the graph.
