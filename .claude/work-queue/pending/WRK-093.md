# Improve dynacard AI diagnostics

## What
Upgrade the dynacard diagnostics engine from threshold-based pattern matching to learning-based classification. Expand failure mode detection beyond the current 6 modes.

## Why
The current `PumpDiagnostics.classify_card()` uses simple threshold comparisons (pump tagging > 38k lbs, fluid pound diff > 5k lbs, etc.). A learning-based approach would improve accuracy and generalize better across different well configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace threshold-based classification with ML/statistical model
- [ ] Add additional failure modes (rod parting, stuck pump, worn barrel, etc.)
- [ ] Validate against existing production well test data
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- [ ] Tests for new classification approach
