# Evaluate IEA Methane Tracker for Upstream O&G ESG Module

## What

Evaluate the IEA Global Methane Tracker 2025 (CC BY 4.0, country-level,
downloadable) for integration into a future `worldenergydata/esg_carbon`
module.

## Why

The 2025 update adds country-level historical emissions data and an
open-access abatement model. This complements Climate TRACE (facility-level)
and EDGAR (national inventories) — natural complement to WRK-476.

## Deliverables

- Evaluation report: data format, coverage, API/download access
- Schema mapping to proposed esg_carbon module
- Recommendation: integrate or defer

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] IEA Methane Tracker data downloaded and inspected
- [ ] Data format and schema documented
- [ ] Coverage assessed (countries, years, sectors)
- [ ] License compatibility confirmed (CC BY 4.0)
- [ ] Integration recommendation with rationale
