# Download and Parse Rig Spec PDFs (102 PDFs from 4 Operators)

## What
Download and parse 102 individual rig specification PDFs identified during WRK-104 Step 0 validation: Transocean (26), Noble (28), Borr (31), Seadrill (17). Extract detailed hull dimensions, BOP specs, riser capacity, derrick/hookload, moonpool, and DP class.

## Why
Spec PDFs contain the most detailed rig data available publicly — hull dimensions, equipment specifications, and operational parameters. This data has source priority 6 (`contractor_spec_pdf`) in the deduplicator, making it the highest-quality non-manual source. Hull dimensions from spec PDFs are critical for linking rigs to RAO datasets (WRK-115) and hull geometry models (WRK-102).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PDF downloader retrieves spec sheets from URLs captured in contractor scrape JSON
- [ ] PDF parser extracts structured data using pdfplumber
- [ ] Handle image-based PDFs gracefully (Transocean — log warning, keep fleet-table data)
- [ ] ≥50 PDFs successfully parsed for structured spec data
- [ ] Hull dimensions (LOA, beam, draft, displacement, moonpool) captured
- [ ] Pontoon/column dimensions captured for semi-subs (for diffraction analysis)
- [ ] Output to `data/modules/vessel_fleet/raw/spec_details/` per operator
- [ ] Merged into curated fleet via deduplicator (source priority: `contractor_spec_pdf=6`)
- [ ] Unit tests with sample PDF fixtures
- [ ] Caching: `data/modules/vessel_fleet/.local/spec_cache/` with 30-day TTL

## Reference
- PDF URLs captured in: `data/modules/vessel_fleet/raw/contractor_scrape/*.json`
- Transocean: 26 PDFs at `deepwater.com/documents/RigSpecs/`
- Noble: 28 PDFs at `s201.q4cdn.com`
- Borr: 31 PDFs at `api.borrdrilling.com/wp-content/uploads/`
- Seadrill: 17 PDFs at `seadrill.com/wp-content/uploads/`
