# Update OrcaFlex License Agreement

## What
Update the OrcaFlex license agreement document with correct party addresses, ensure compliance with the existing ACMA-OrcaFlex agreement, and clarify 3rd-party usage terms.

## Reference Documents
- **Preliminary agreement**: `D:\workspace-hub\aceengineer-admin\admin\orcaflex\`
- **ACMA agreement to comply with**: `ACMA-OrcaFlex-agreement.pdf` (same folder)

## Required Changes

### 1. Add Party Addresses
- **ACMA Address**: 565 S. Mason Road #395, Katy, Texas 77450
- **Achanta Aceengineer Inc Address**: 11511 Piping Rock Dr., Houston, TX 77077

### 2. Compliance Check
- Review `ACMA-OrcaFlex-agreement.pdf` and ensure the updated agreement complies with all terms

### 3. Third-Party Clarification
- Clarify the definition and role of "3rd party" in the agreement
- Add 3rd-party usage terms if needed to cover sublicensing or subcontracting scenarios

## Why
Proper legal documentation with correct addresses, compliance with existing agreements, and clear 3rd-party terms protects all parties and ensures the OrcaFlex license is used within contractual bounds.

- [ ] ACMA address added to agreement: 565 S. Mason Road #395, Katy, Texas 77450
