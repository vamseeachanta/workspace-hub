# Audit HSE public data coverage and identify gaps

## What
Conduct a comprehensive audit of all HSE (Health, Safety, Environment) public data currently collected in the worldenergydata repository. Determine whether all available public data sources have been researched and acquired across key categories: BSEE incidents, marine incidents, marine pipeline installation incidents, marine navigation incidents, onshore oil and gas incidents, industrial incidents, and any other relevant HSE data sources.

## Why
Before performing analysis or building client deliverables, we need confidence that the data foundation is complete. Missing data categories would produce incomplete risk profiles and mislead downstream analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inventory all HSE datasets currently in worldenergydata
- [ ] List all known public HSE data sources by category:
  - BSEE incidents
  - Marine incidents
  - Marine pipeline installation incidents
  - Marine navigation incidents
  - Onshore oil and gas incidents
  - Industrial incidents
  - Other relevant HSE sources
- [ ] For each source: status (acquired/partial/missing), date range, record count
- [ ] Identify gaps — sources not yet researched or acquired
- [ ] Recommend next steps for filling gaps
- [ ] Document findings in a data status report

*Source: HSE data status. Did we research and get all the public data possible? BSEE incidents, marine incidents, marine pipeline installation, marine navigation incidents, onshore oil and gas incidents, industrial incidents etc.*
