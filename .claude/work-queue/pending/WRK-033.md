# Develop OrcaFlex include-file modular skill for parametrised analysis input

## What
Develop a skill (or tooling module) in digitalmodel that prepares OrcaFlex analysis input files using a modular include-file approach. The input file is broken into sections so that variables can be easily parametrised for different analyses, structures, environments, locations, etc.

## Why
OrcaFlex analysis input files often require repetitive configuration changes across analyses (different environments, water depths, structures, locations). A modular include-file approach allows each section to be independently parametrised and reused, reducing manual effort and errors when setting up analysis campaigns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Modular skill/module that generates OrcaFlex input files from sectioned include-files
- [ ] Sections for key variable groups (analysis type, structure, environment, location, etc.)
- [ ] Each section independently parametrised with clear variable definitions
- [ ] Ability to compose a full OrcaFlex input file from selected section combinations
- [ ] Support for variable substitution/templating within sections
- [ ] Validation that composed input files are well-formed for OrcaFlex
- [ ] Tests covering section composition and variable parametrisation
- [ ] Documentation for the include-file format and skill usage
