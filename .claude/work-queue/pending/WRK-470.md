# feat(gtm): Oil & Gas Practitioner Persona + 1-Month GTM Plan

## Objective

Define a primary ICP (ideal customer profile) persona — the "Oil Man" — and build a
focused 1-month go-to-market plan to demonstrate value of the workspace-hub ecosystem
to the upstream/midstream oil & gas engineering community.

---

## Persona: "The Oil Man" — Senior O&G Practitioner

### Profile
- **Role**: Senior Petroleum / Subsea / Pipeline Engineer or Engineering Manager
- **Industry**: Upstream E&P, midstream pipeline, deepwater, offshore construction
- **Experience**: 10–25 yrs; has worked at operators (majors/NOCs) or large EPCs
- **Tools today**: Excel, in-house Fortran/MATLAB scripts, SESAM, OrcaFlex, HYSYS,
  Landmark/Halliburton suites — mostly siloed, hard to automate
- **Pain points**:
  - Repeating the same standards calculations (DNV, API, ABS) across projects
  - No version-controlled audit trail for engineering calculations
  - Manual handoffs between disciplines (structural → mooring → riser → cost)
  - Offshore decline curves estimated by hand or black-box tools
  - No AI augmentation in the engineering workflow
- **Goals**:
  - Reduce time from concept to bankable engineering deliverable
  - Audit-ready, reproducible calculation notebooks
  - Integrate cost/NPV models with engineering outputs
  - Stay ahead of digital transformation without rebuilding tooling from scratch

### Quote (synthetic)
> "I know Python exists. I just need something that already speaks DNV-RP-B401
>  and hands me a calculation pack I can sign off on."

## Relevant Repos for This Persona

| Repo | O&G Value |
|---|---|
| `assetutilities` | Standards calculations: DNV, ABS, API — CP, riser, casing, VIV |
| `digitalmodel` | Drilling ROP models, mooring, hydrodynamics, FEA/CFD integration |
| `worldenergydata` | EIA production data, Arps decline curves, shale analytics |
| `assethold` | CRE/asset financials — crossover to field economics (WRK-259/261) |

## 1-Month GTM Timeline

### Week 1 — Foundation (Days 1–7)
- [ ] Write 1-page "value brief" targeting the Oil Man persona (PDF via `data:md-to-pdf`)
- [ ] Identify 3 flagship calculation demos: (1) CP cathodic protection per DNV-RP-B401,
      (2) Arps hyperbolic decline curve with EIA data, (3) Walgreens-style NN lease
      financial model (shows cross-domain depth)
- [ ] Create `specs/gtm/oil-man-persona.md` with full persona card
- [ ] Draft capability map: which repo covers which O&G discipline

### Week 2 — Demo Assets (Days 8–14)
- [ ] Build shareable Jupyter notebook: CP design + DNV compliance check
- [ ] Build shareable Jupyter notebook: production decline forecast (worldenergydata)
- [ ] Create short README / landing copy for each repo targeting O&G audience
- [ ] Record or document a "5-minute demo" flow: input → calculation → PDF report

### Week 3 — Outreach Prep (Days 15–21)
- [ ] Identify 10 target contacts: LinkedIn (subsea engineers, PE consultants,
      independent operators, small EPCs)
- [ ] Draft outreach message templates (email + LinkedIn DM)
- [ ] Prepare FAQ: "Is this open source?", "Does it replace OrcaFlex?",
      "What standards are covered?", "How do I get started?"
- [ ] Set up simple intake: GitHub Discussions or email alias

### Week 4 — Launch & Measure (Days 22–30)
- [ ] Share demo notebooks on LinkedIn (personal + engineering groups)
- [ ] Post in relevant communities: SPE LinkedIn group, r/petroleum, O&G Slack channels
- [ ] Reach out to 5 warm contacts individually
- [ ] Capture feedback: what resonates, what gaps remain
- [ ] Write retrospective WRK item for Month 2 based on learnings

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `specs/gtm/oil-man-persona.md` committed with full persona card
- [ ] 2 shareable demo notebooks published (CP + decline curve)
- [ ] 1-page value brief PDF generated
- [ ] Outreach templates drafted and reviewed
- [ ] Week 4 retrospective WRK item created

---

## Notes
- Keep messaging practitioner-first: "calculations you can sign off on",
  not "AI-powered platform"
- Emphasise audit trail + reproducibility — these are regulatory requirements
- CRE/assethold angle is secondary for this persona; lead with engineering calcs
- Month 2 expansion: BSEE economics (WRK-259/261), planing hull demo (WRK-394),
  AQWA batch execution (WRK-372)
