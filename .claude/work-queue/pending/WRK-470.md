## Problem

A file with a Windows-illegal filename (colon in name) was committed to the remote
`workspace-hub` main branch and is blocking all Windows machines from merging:

```
.claude/work-queue/pending/Exit code:
```

Colons are not allowed in filenames on Windows/NTFS. Any `git merge`, `git pull`,
or `git reset --hard` on a Windows machine fails with:

```
error: unable to create file .claude/work-queue/pending/Exit code: : Invalid argument
Merge with strategy ort failed.
```

## Resolution (from Linux machine)

```bash
cd /path/to/workspace-hub

# Remove the bad file
git rm ".claude/work-queue/pending/Exit code:"

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "fix: remove Windows-illegal filename from work queue

Remove .claude/work-queue/pending/Exit code: which contains a colon —
illegal on Windows/NTFS. Blocks all Windows machines from merging.

Fixes WRK-470"

git push origin main
```

## Blocked Work

Windows machine (this machine) has a feature branch `chore/wrk-470-windows-merge-fix`
with 4 local commits that need to be merged back after this fix:

- `8905e2c` chore(workspace-hub): sync submodules, close WRK-310/311, add WRK-323–328
- `8c7a2cb` chore(orcawave): add WRK-317–322 work items and update OrcaWave skills
- `f2123bb` chore(work-queue): close WRK-315 + WRK-316; capture session knowledge
- `872f037` chore(work-queue): add WRK-315 and WRK-316 — legacy OrcFxAPI script migration

## After Linux Fix

From Windows machine:

```bash
cd /d/workspace-hub
git checkout main
git pull --no-rebase origin main   # should now succeed
git merge chore/wrk-470-windows-merge-fix --no-edit
git push origin main
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `Exit code:` file removed from `origin/main`
- [ ] Windows machine can `git pull --no-rebase origin main` without error
- [ ] Feature branch merged back into main and pushed
- [ ] Feature branch deleted after merge
