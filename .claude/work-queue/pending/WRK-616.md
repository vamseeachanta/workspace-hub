# chore(wrk-309): Convert Document-Intelligence Findings into Structured Data Sources

## What

Standing policy work item: **wherever document intelligence (WRK-309) identifies calculation
files, workbooks, or structured data on `/mnt/ace`, create a structured `specs/data-sources/`
YAML entry and corresponding WRK item** to implement that data as a typed data model in the
appropriate repo.

This item tracks the meta-process. Specific conversion WRK items are created as sub-tasks.

## Why

The document index (`data/document-index/index.jsonl`, 945K records) is only useful when its
findings propagate into the codebase as:
- `calc_examples` entries → test verification data (pattern established by WRK-560)
- `data_sources` → structured readers/parsers
- `gaps` → new implementation WRK items

Without this conversion loop, document intelligence stays a one-off audit rather than a
continuous source of engineering capability improvements.

## Trigger Rule

> Whenever a new domain or standard is identified in document intelligence, OR whenever
> `query-docs.sh` reveals previously undocumented calculation files, add an entry to
> `specs/data-sources/<repo>.yaml` under `calc_examples` and file a WRK item to implement
> the data model.

## Known Conversion Backlog (from WRK-309 Phase D)

### Pipeline domain (digitalmodel) — calc_examples populated by WRK-560
- [x] DNV-OS-F101, DNV-OS-F201, DNV-RP-F109, API-RP-1111 → WRK-560 DONE

### FEA domain (digitalmodel)
- [ ] 0116 thinwall FEA ANSYS Workbench parametric model → WRK-615
- [ ] 611 Mecor pipeline ANSYS WB models (4 sensitivity studies) → WRK-615
- [ ] Woodfibre LNG QRH ANSYS Workbench model → WRK-617 (APDL scripts)
- [ ] 614 Sewol global APDL model → WRK-617

### Drilling domain (digitalmodel / assetutilities)
- [ ] 0145 FDAS Tensioner Cart FE — ANSYS WB project → WRK item needed
- [ ] 0159 WCOT Downhole Tool FEA — ANSYS WB Mandrel + Ratchet → WRK item needed

### Riser / mooring domain (digitalmodel)
- [ ] BP Macondo containment riser — `common.inp` APDL modal analysis models → WRK-617
- [ ] BLK31 SLOR installation VIV — `common.inp` APDL modal analysis → WRK-617

### Standards / standards checks (assetutilities/calculations)
- Document index identifies >20 calculation workbooks per standard domain
- Each standard's calcs → verify existing assetutilities.calculations unit tests
  (WRK-420..469 series)

## Process (per domain)

1. Run `scripts/readiness/query-docs.sh --domain <domain> --keyword "<standard>"` to locate
   relevant files in the document index
2. `ls -la` verify file access on ace-linux-1
3. Add entry to `specs/data-sources/<repo>.yaml` → `calc_examples:` or `data_sources:`
4. File a targeted WRK item (Medium complexity) to implement the data model / reader
5. Link WRK item back to this WRK-616 in `related:`
6. Update `percent_complete` on this item as domains are converted

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All identified FEA assets registered in `specs/data-sources/digitalmodel.yaml`
- [ ] All identified drilling calc workbooks have WRK items (assetutilities/calculations domain)
- [ ] Riser/mooring APDL models catalogued in `specs/data-sources/digitalmodel.yaml`
- [ ] At least 3 new data-source YAML entries added (beyond WRK-560's pipeline domain)
- [ ] Each YAML entry has: `standard`, `domain`, `description`, `files` with `path`, `type`,
      `description`
