# Acquire NTSB CAROL marine investigations and EPA TRI data

## What
Query NTSB CAROL (data.ntsb.gov) for mode=marine and export as CSV. Download EPA TRI basic data files (1987-present) from EPA. Build TRI importer.

## Why
NTSB marine importer is ready but has no data. EPA TRI covers toxic releases from 1987 with 1M+ records.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Export NTSB CAROL marine data as CSV
- [ ] Import using existing ntsb_importer.py
- [ ] Download EPA TRI basic data files
- [ ] Build EPA TRI importer
- [ ] Import both datasets
- [ ] Document record counts and date ranges

## Progress
- 2026-02-01: EPA TRI — Acquirer and importer built. 51,503 records acquired (2020-2024, oil & gas filtered). ToxicRelease model added to DB.
- 2026-02-01: NTSB CAROL — Acquirer built but CAROL marine API not publicly accessible. Manual export guide generated at data/modules/marine_safety/raw/ntsb/NTSB_CAROL_MANUAL_EXPORT_GUIDE.md. Existing ntsb_importer.py ready to process manually exported CSV.
- Refresh scripts: scripts/refresh_epa_tri.sh, scripts/refresh_ntsb_marine.sh.
