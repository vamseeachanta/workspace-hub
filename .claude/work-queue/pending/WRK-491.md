# feat(digitalmodel/cathodic_protection): Implement ISO 15589-2 — ISO15589-2-2004forOR Cathodic Protection

## Standard
- **Standard**: ISO 15589-2
- **Full title**: ISO15589-2-2004forOR Cathodic Protection
- **Domain**: cathodic-protection
- **Document path**: `/mnt/ace/0000 O&G/0000 Codes & Standards/ISO/ISO Misc/ISO15589-2-2004forOR Cathodic Protection.pdf`

## What

Implement engineering calculations and data models from **ISO 15589-2**
in the `digitalmodel` repository, module `cathodic_protection`.

This standard was identified in Phase C/E of WRK-309 (Document Intelligence)
as a gap — the document exists on the drives but its content has not been
implemented in the target repo.

## Why

**ISO 15589-2** is a key industry standard in the `cathodic-protection` domain.
Implementing its calculations enables agents and engineers to perform
rigorous code-compliant analysis directly from the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core calculations / design checks implemented with unit tests
- [ ] Input validation at parameter boundaries
- [ ] Docstring cites the standard clause/equation numbers
- [ ] Example usage verified against standard worked example (if available)
- [ ] Cross-review passed via `scripts/review/cross-review.sh`
