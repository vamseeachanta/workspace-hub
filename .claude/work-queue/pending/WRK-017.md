# Streamline BSEE field data analysis and interpretation pipeline

## What
Build a streamlined, end-to-end analysis and interpretation pipeline for BSEE field data covering:
1. **Wellbore data**: wellbore counts per lease/field/region
2. **Well path data**: directional survey interpretation and visualization
3. **Casing program schematics**: auto-generated casing diagrams drawn from size data, supporting both graphical schematics and old-style matrix format
4. **Drilling and completion activities**: timeline and summary analysis
5. **Intervention activities**: analysis and filtering by lease, field, and geological region

The pipeline should accept a lease, field, or geological region as input and produce a consolidated data package with analysis and visualizations.

## Why
Currently, field data analysis requires manual assembly across multiple BSEE data tables. A streamlined pipeline reduces turnaround time, ensures consistency, and enables rapid field-level reporting for client deliverables. Casing schematics drawn programmatically eliminate manual drafting effort.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wellbore count summary by lease, field, and geological region
- [ ] Well path data extraction and interpretation (directional surveys where available)
- [ ] Casing program schematic generation:
  - Graphical schematic drawn from casing size/depth data
  - Old-style matrix format output (tabular casing string summary)
- [ ] Drilling activity analysis: spud dates, duration, rig types, water depth distribution
- [ ] Completion activity analysis: completion types, dates, intervals
- [ ] Intervention activity analysis: workover types, frequencies, filtered by lease/field/geological region
- [ ] Consolidated output per field or lease query
- [ ] Pipeline accepts lease number, field name, or geological region as input parameter
- [ ] Visualizations for each data domain
- [ ] Document data sources, pipeline steps, and output formats

## Plan

**Spec**: `specs/modules/wrk-017-bsee-field-pipeline.md`
**Target**: `src/worldenergydata/bsee/pipeline/`

### Existing Assets (reuse)
- `AllFieldsRunner` + `FieldNameResolver` + `EraClassifier` — field aggregation
- `ComprehensiveActivityAnalyzer` — 7-module WAR analyzer (drilling efficiency, depth, era, cross-activity, lifecycle, operator, benchmarking)
- `WellAPI12` — well history/timeline; `ProductionAPI12Analysis` — production aggregation
- `analysis/intervention/` — activity aggregation, enrichment, dashboards, field vis, insight generator
- `analysis/financial/` — NPV, cash flow, drilling cost modeling
- Data loaders: `bsee/data/loaders/well/`, `bsee/data/loaders/block/`, `bsee/data/loaders/lease/`, `bsee/data/loaders/infrastructure/`, `bsee/data/loaders/rig_fleet/`
- Catalog data: `well_tubulars.csv` (casing size/grade/weight/depth), `completion_*.csv`
  - **Prerequisite**: Confirm `well_tubulars.csv` exists and document its exact path. If not present, add data acquisition as Phase 0.

### Phase 1 — Unified Query Interface (new)
- `field_query.py` — Accept lease number, field name, or geological region
- Resolve to lease set via `FieldNameResolver` + `EraClassifier`
- Return `FieldContext` dataclass (leases, field name, area code, geological era)

### Phase 2 — Casing Schematic Generator (new, gap)
- `casing_schematic.py` — Read `well_tubulars.csv` casing data
- SVG schematic output (ref: digitalmodel `svg_primitives.py` pattern)
- Old-style matrix tabular output (DataFrame)

### Phase 3 — Pipeline Orchestrator (new)
- `pipeline_runner.py` — Takes `FieldContext`, runs existing analyzers:
  1. Wellbore count summary (AllFieldsRunner)
  2. Production analysis (ProductionAPI12Analysis)
  3. Drilling/completion activities (ComprehensiveActivityAnalyzer)
  4. Intervention analysis (intervention/ module)
  5. Casing schematics (Phase 2)
  6. Financial summary (analysis/financial/)
- Consolidate into `FieldReport` dataclass

### Phase 4 — Report Generation (new)
- `field_report.py` — HTML/Markdown report with Plotly charts from `intervention/dashboard.py`
- Reuse `reports/comprehensive/exporters/` for Excel/PDF

### Phase 5 — Tests
- Unit tests per new module (target: 15+ per module, 80% coverage)
- Integration test with Buckskin field (known data, see WRK-024)
- Golden-field integration test with fixed expected row counts
- Test with materialized production data (`mv_productionsum.bin`)
- Test LFS stub fallback behavior per analyzer (return empty DataFrame + warning)

### Data Constraints
- 129/133 `.bin` files are LFS stubs — pipeline must handle gracefully
- Deferred: wellbore path visualization (requires LFS pull for directional surveys)
- Deferred: decline curves (WRK-077)

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MINOR | Gemini: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - Replaced "Data routers: WellRouter, BlockRouter, ..." with actual loader directory paths (no router classes exist in codebase)
  - Added prerequisite to verify `well_tubulars.csv` path before Phase 2
  - Expanded Phase 5 test strategy with specific targets (15+ tests/module, 80% coverage, named integration field)
  - Added LFS stub fallback testing requirement
