# Streamline BSEE field data analysis and interpretation pipeline

## What
Build a streamlined, end-to-end analysis and interpretation pipeline for BSEE field data covering:
1. **Wellbore data**: wellbore counts per lease/field/region
2. **Well path data**: directional survey interpretation and visualization
3. **Casing program schematics**: auto-generated casing diagrams drawn from size data, supporting both graphical schematics and old-style matrix format
4. **Drilling and completion activities**: timeline and summary analysis
5. **Intervention activities**: analysis and filtering by lease, field, and geological region

The pipeline should accept a lease, field, or geological region as input and produce a consolidated data package with analysis and visualizations.

## Why
Currently, field data analysis requires manual assembly across multiple BSEE data tables. A streamlined pipeline reduces turnaround time, ensures consistency, and enables rapid field-level reporting for client deliverables. Casing schematics drawn programmatically eliminate manual drafting effort.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wellbore count summary by lease, field, and geological region
- [ ] Well path data extraction and interpretation (directional surveys where available)
- [ ] Casing program schematic generation:
  - Graphical schematic drawn from casing size/depth data
  - Old-style matrix format output (tabular casing string summary)
- [ ] Drilling activity analysis: spud dates, duration, rig types, water depth distribution
- [ ] Completion activity analysis: completion types, dates, intervals
- [ ] Intervention activity analysis: workover types, frequencies, filtered by lease/field/geological region
- [ ] Consolidated output per field or lease query
- [ ] Pipeline accepts lease number, field name, or geological region as input parameter
- [ ] Visualizations for each data domain
- [ ] Document data sources, pipeline steps, and output formats

*Source: for bsee data, stream line all field data analysis and interpretation i.e. wellbore count, well path data, casing program schematic (drawn based on sizes and old style matrix format), drilling and completion activities, intervention activities based on the lease, field, geological region etc.*
