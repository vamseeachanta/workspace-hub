# Validate and wire decline curve modeling into BSEE production workflow

## What
Connect the existing forecasting/decline curve code (exponential, hyperbolic, harmonic models in sodir/forecasting.py) to actual BSEE production data with an end-to-end example. Currently the code exists but is not integrated into any production workflow.

## Why
Website markets "production forecasting and decline curve modeling" as a core FDAS capability. The code exists but has never been run against real production data in a documented workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Decline curve models fit to real BSEE field production data
- [ ] At least one documented example with a Gulf of Mexico field
- [ ] Comparison of exponential vs hyperbolic vs harmonic fits
- [ ] Forecast output with confidence intervals
- [ ] Plotly visualization of historical data + forecast
- [ ] Integration test with real data
- [ ] CLI command to run forecast on any BSEE field
