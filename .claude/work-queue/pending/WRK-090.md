## Description

Reflect state flagged 12 large files exceeding the 400-line hard limit defined in `coding-style.md`. These files may need splitting by responsibility.

## Tasks

- [ ] Identify all source files (py, ts, js, sh) exceeding 400 lines in workspace (excluding submodules, node_modules, generated files)
- [ ] Assess each file: is it a candidate for splitting or acceptable as-is (data, config, etc.)
- [ ] Split files that have multiple responsibilities into focused modules
- [ ] Verify no functionality is broken after refactoring

## Context

Identified during reflect review on 2026-02-03. Coding style rule: 400-line hard limit, 200-line soft target.
