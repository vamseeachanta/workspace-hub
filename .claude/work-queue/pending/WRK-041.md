# Develop long-term plan for Hobbies repo

## What
Create a long-term plan/roadmap for the Hobbies repository — defining its purpose, structure, content goals, and development direction.

## Why
A clear long-term plan provides direction for the repo, prevents aimless accumulation, and ensures the repo serves its intended purpose effectively over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review current state of the Hobbies repo (content, structure, activity)
- [ ] Define the repo's purpose and scope
- [ ] Outline long-term goals and milestones
- [ ] Plan documented and committed to the repo
