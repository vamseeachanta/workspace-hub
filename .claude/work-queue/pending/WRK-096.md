# Install and Configure BEMRosetta CLI

## What
Download and install BEMRosetta command-line executable (`BEMRosetta_cl.exe`) for use in the 3-way solver benchmark comparison. Configure PATH and verify installation.

## Why
BEMRosetta is required as the third solver (alongside AQWA and OrcaWave) for the WRK-031 3-way benchmark comparison. It's open-source (GPL) and provides access to NEMOH/HAMS solvers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] BEMRosetta_cl.exe downloaded from official GitHub releases
- [x] Executable accessible from command line (added to PATH or config)
- [x] Version verification: `BEMRosetta_cl -help` works
- [ ] Basic mesh conversion test: GDF → DAT conversion works
- [x] Document installation path in project config

## Resolution
Found existing installation at `D:/software/BEMRosetta/BEMRosetta_cl.exe`
- Version: beta 2025031622, release, 64 bits
- Verified working: 2026-02-05
