# Complete marine safety database importers (MAIB, IMO, EMSA, TSB)

## What
Finish the marine safety importers that are currently stubs. Working scrapers exist for USCG, NTSB, ATSB. The MAIB, IMO, EMSA, TSB, MISLE, Boating, and NOAA importers need to be completed with actual data collection logic to back the website's "10+ authorities" claim.

## Why
The aceengineer website now markets "10+ international safety databases integrated." Currently only 3-5 are functional. This creates a trust risk if prospects ask for a demo or deliverable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MAIB importer collects UK marine accident investigation data
- [ ] IMO importer collects GISIS incident data
- [ ] EMSA importer collects European maritime safety data
- [ ] TSB importer collects Canadian transportation safety data
- [ ] Each importer has tests with real sample data
- [ ] All importers write to the unified marine_safety database schema
- [ ] At least 8 of 10+ claimed sources are functional
