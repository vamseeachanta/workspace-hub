# Develop OrcaWave modular file prep skill for parametrised analysis input

## What
Develop a skill/module in digitalmodel that prepares OrcaWave analysis input files using a modular sectioned approach. The input file is broken into sections so that variables can be easily parametrised for different analyses, structures, environments, locations, etc.

## Why
OrcaWave diffraction analysis input files require configuration changes across analyses (different vessel structures, environments, water depths, wave headings, locations). A modular file prep approach allows each section to be independently parametrised and reused, reducing manual effort and errors when setting up OrcaWave analysis campaigns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Modular skill/module that generates OrcaWave input files from sectioned templates
- [ ] Sections for key variable groups (analysis type, structure/vessel, environment, location, etc.)
- [ ] Each section independently parametrised with clear variable definitions
- [ ] Ability to compose a full OrcaWave input file from selected section combinations
- [ ] Support for variable substitution/templating within sections
- [ ] Validation that composed input files are well-formed for OrcaWave
- [ ] Tests covering section composition and variable parametrisation
- [ ] Documentation for the modular format and skill usage
