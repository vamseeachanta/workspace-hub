# Jabra USB Dongle Lost — Universal Dongle Compatibility

## What
Jabra USB dongle has been lost. Research whether a universal Bluetooth dongle can replace the original Jabra dongle for the headset.

## Why
- Need to restore headset functionality without purchasing an exact OEM replacement
- Universal dongles are cheaper and more readily available

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify Jabra headset model
- [ ] Research if Jabra headsets work with generic Bluetooth USB dongles
- [ ] If Jabra-specific: find replacement dongle options and pricing
- [ ] If universal works: recommend a compatible universal dongle
- [ ] Document any pairing steps required

## Plan
- **Step 1**: Identify the exact Jabra headset model (check device, packaging, or settings)
- **Step 2**: Check Jabra support docs — some models (Evolve2, Engage) require the proprietary Jabra Link dongle; others (Elite, Talk) use standard Bluetooth
- **Step 3**: If proprietary required: Jabra Link 380/390 available separately (~$30-50). If standard BT: any USB BT 5.0 dongle works
- **Step 4**: Document findings

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Hardware research (Jabra dongle compatibility) is a personal procurement task with no ecosystem agentic value.
- Web research and product comparison agents handle this type of task well already.
- **Disposition: do now** — trivial task; execute immediately or with a web-search agent; no reason to defer.
