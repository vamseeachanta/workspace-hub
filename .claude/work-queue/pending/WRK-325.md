# Sector exposure tracker — auto-classify holdings by GICS sector and flag concentration

## What

Auto-classify portfolio holdings by GICS sector using yfinance fundamentals. Track sector
weights, flag over-concentration (>30% single sector). Output: sector breakdown chart,
rebalancing suggestions. Wire into daily strategy output.

## Why

Sector concentration is a key portfolio risk factor. Automatic GICS classification and
concentration monitoring ensures diversification is maintained without manual tracking. A 30%
single-sector threshold provides an early warning for rebalancing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GICS sector classification pull from yfinance for each holding
- [ ] Sector weight calculation (market value weighted)
- [ ] Concentration flag: warning when any sector exceeds 30% of portfolio
- [ ] Sector breakdown output: table and bar chart (matplotlib or console)
- [ ] Rebalancing suggestions: sectors to trim/add based on target allocation
- [ ] Wire into existing daily strategy output
- [ ] Pytest coverage with sample portfolio and known sector classifications
