# WRK-210: Interoperability Skill — Cross-OS Standards and Health Checks

## What

Create a skill at `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/interoperability/SKILL.md`
documenting all cross-OS standards enforced in workspace-hub: encoding, line
endings, uv as Python resolver, hook installation, and health check items to
run regularly. Skill should surface as a health check reference across
repo-sync, improve, and session-exit workflows.

## Why

**Session trigger (2026-02-19)**: WRK-208 encoded cross-OS fixes in scripts
and hooks, but the institutional knowledge (why, how, what to check) lived
only in session context. User: "all of these notes should go into health
checks for each skill and should be checked regularly so things are not lost."

Without a canonical skill, every new session must re-derive the standards
from scratch. The skill makes these checkable and enforceable across sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `SKILL.md` created at `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/interoperability/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Skill covers: UTF-8/no-BOM standard, `.gitattributes` enforcement,
      `check-encoding.sh` hook, `git config core.hooksPath`, uv as Python resolver
- [ ] Health check section: items to verify at session start or after repo-sync
- [ ] Cross-linked to: `repo-sync`, `improve`, `skill-creator`, `WRK-208`/`WRK-209`
- [ ] `repo-sync` SKILL.md updated to reference this skill in its health check phase

## Plan

Route A — inline plan. User approved 2026-02-19.

**Deliverables**:
1. `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/interoperability/SKILL.md` — new skill
2. Update `repo-sync` SKILL.md health check reference
3. Ensure `improve` skill's Phase 3 ecosystem checks reference interoperability
