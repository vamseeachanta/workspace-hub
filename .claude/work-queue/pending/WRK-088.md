## Description

Three submodule issues identified during uncommitted changes review:

1. **pdf-large-reader** — has untracked content inside the submodule, no new commits
2. **worldenergydata** — has modified content inside the submodule (pointer was committed but internal changes remain)
3. **aceengineercode** — path exists in working tree with no corresponding `.gitmodules` entry

## Tasks

- [ ] Check `pdf-large-reader` for untracked content and either commit or gitignore
- [ ] Check `worldenergydata` for uncommitted modifications and resolve
- [ ] Investigate `aceengineercode` mapping — fix `.gitmodules` or remove orphaned directory
