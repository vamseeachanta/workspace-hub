## Description

Three submodule issues identified during uncommitted changes review:

1. **pdf-large-reader** — has untracked content inside the submodule, no new commits
2. **worldenergydata** — has modified content inside the submodule (pointer was committed but internal changes remain)
3. **aceengineercode** — path exists in working tree with no corresponding `.gitmodules` entry

## Tasks

- [ ] Check `pdf-large-reader` for untracked content and either commit or gitignore
- [ ] Check `worldenergydata` for uncommitted modifications and resolve
- [ ] Investigate `aceengineercode` mapping — fix `.gitmodules` or remove orphaned directory

## Plan

### Current State (from research 2026-02-09)

1. **pdf-large-reader**: Clean. `git status` inside the submodule shows `nothing to commit, working tree clean`. Branch is `master`, up to date with `origin/master`. The workspace-hub `git submodule status` shows `+37339e0` (ahead of pointer) but the submodule itself is clean. Resolution: update the workspace-hub submodule pointer.

2. **worldenergydata**: Has uncommitted modifications inside the submodule:
   - Modified: `reports/coverage/coverage.json`
   - Untracked: `frontierdeepwater/`, `reports/bsee/`, several scripts (`scripts/bsee/analyze_buckskin.py`, `scripts/build_drilling_report.py`, `scripts/build_intervention_detail_report.py`), several spec files, and new source/test dirs (`src/worldenergydata/bsee/analysis/buckskin/`, `tests/modules/bsee/analysis/buckskin/`)
   - The `frontierdeepwater/` untracked dir inside worldenergydata is suspicious -- likely a nested submodule or accidental clone

3. **aceengineercode**: The directory does **not exist** on disk. There is no `.gitmodules` entry for it. The workspace-hub directory listing shows `aceengineer-admin` and `aceengineer-website` but no `aceengineercode`. This issue may have been resolved already, or the original report was based on stale state. Verify with `git ls-files --error-unmatch aceengineercode` and `git ls-tree HEAD aceengineercode`.

### Step 1: Resolve pdf-large-reader (5 min)

1. Run `cd pdf-large-reader && git log --oneline -1` to confirm current commit
2. At workspace-hub level: `git add pdf-large-reader` to update the submodule pointer
3. Verify with `git diff --cached pdf-large-reader`

### Step 2: Resolve worldenergydata (15 min)

1. Decide on untracked files inside worldenergydata:
   - `reports/bsee/`, `scripts/bsee/analyze_buckskin.py`, `scripts/build_*.py`: likely work-in-progress -- either commit or add to `.gitignore`
   - `src/worldenergydata/bsee/analysis/buckskin/` and `tests/modules/bsee/analysis/buckskin/`: new analysis module -- commit if ready, gitignore if WIP
   - `frontierdeepwater/`: investigate -- if it is a nested clone, remove it and add to `.gitignore`
   - `specs/modules/*.md`: auto-generated spec files -- commit or gitignore
2. Handle modified `reports/coverage/coverage.json`: add to `.gitignore` (generated artifact) or commit if tracked intentionally
3. Commit inside worldenergydata submodule first, then update pointer at workspace-hub level

### Step 3: Verify aceengineercode (5 min)

1. Run `git ls-tree HEAD | grep aceengineercode` at workspace-hub level
2. Run `git log --all --oneline -- aceengineercode | head -5` to check history
3. If no tree entry and no directory: mark as resolved (was stale state)
4. If a git tree entry exists without a directory: `git rm aceengineercode` to clean the index

### Step 4: Final Verification

1. Run `git submodule status` at workspace-hub level
2. Confirm no `+` (ahead) or `-` (uninitialized) prefixes on pdf-large-reader or worldenergydata
3. Run `git status` to confirm clean state for resolved items

### Review Notes

**Cross-review date**: 2026-02-10

| Reviewer | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Claude Opus 4.6 | APPROVE |
| Gemini CLI | APPROVE |
| Codex CLI | NO_OUTPUT |

**Feedback incorporated**:
- aceengineercode issue already resolved (no directory, no .gitmodules entry, no git tree entry)
- Steps are pragmatic and low-risk
