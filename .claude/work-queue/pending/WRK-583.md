# Verify ANP Brazil Production Data REST API Availability

## What

Verify whether ANP BDEP (Banco de Dados de Exploração e Produção) and
re3data r3d100010989 provide REST API access to Brazilian production data.

## Why

Brazil is a major offshore producer. Programmatic access to ANP data
would extend worldenergydata coverage to South American basins.

## Deliverables

- API availability report: endpoints, auth, rate limits, data format
- Sample data extraction if API exists
- Recommendation: create WRK for integration or defer

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ANP BDEP portal inspected for API documentation
- [ ] re3data entry reviewed for access methods
- [ ] API tested if available (sample query)
- [ ] Report written with go/no-go recommendation
