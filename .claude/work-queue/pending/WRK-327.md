# Shared engineering constants library — material properties unit conversions seawater properties

## What

Extract engineering constants from digitalmodel and centralise as a shared library accessible
to all repos. Material properties (steel grades, density, E, nu, Fy), seawater properties
(rho, mu vs temperature/salinity), unit conversion tables. Install via pyproject.toml.

## Why

Engineering constants are currently duplicated across multiple repos. Centralising them
ensures consistency (one source of truth for steel yield strength, seawater density, etc.),
reduces copy-paste errors, and provides a stable foundation for all engineering calculations
across the workspace.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shared library package: `ace-constants` or equivalent, installable via pyproject.toml
- [ ] Steel material properties: API 5L grades (X42-X80), structural steel (A36, A572)
- [ ] Seawater properties: density and viscosity as functions of temperature and salinity
- [ ] Unit conversion utilities: SI/Imperial for common engineering units
- [ ] Constants are immutable (frozen dataclasses or similar)
- [ ] digitalmodel updated to import from shared library instead of local definitions
- [ ] Pytest coverage with known material property values from code references
