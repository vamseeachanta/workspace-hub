# Create marine safety case study — cross-database incident correlation

## What
Write a case study showing cross-database marine safety incident correlation using actual USCG + NTSB data. Follow the existing case study HTML pattern.

## Why
Marine Safety Intelligence is a major marketed service with zero proof points on the website. A case study showing real incident correlation across databases validates the claim.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Case study HTML page in case-studies/ directory
- [ ] Shows USCG + NTSB (minimum) cross-database correlation
- [ ] Demonstrates deduplication and pattern detection
- [ ] Includes visualizations of incident trends
- [ ] Metrics: number of sources correlated, incidents matched, patterns found
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data
- [ ] Linked from energy.html and case-studies/index.html
