# feat(frontierdeepwater): Engineering AI Demo — Calculation Templates + Data Processing (Days 2-3)

## What

Build the Day 2–3 calculation and data processing capabilities for the AI demo.

### Day 2 — Calculation Templates

**Rigid Jumper (SME1) calculations:**
- `ai-initiatives/demo/calc_rigid_jumper_wall_thickness.md` — ASME B31.8 pressure design
  template: P, D, SMYS inputs → hoop stress → t_required → corrosion/tolerance add-ons
- `ai-initiatives/demo/calc_rigid_jumper_combined_stress.md` — Von Mises check template:
  pressure + bending + thermal → σ_e vs η×SMYS
- `ai-initiatives/demo/calc_ffs_level1_wall_loss.md` — API 579-1 Part 4/5 Level 1:
  t_mm/t_min RSF screening; Part 12 plain dent d/D ≤ 6% check
- SCF lookup table from DNV-RP-C203 (girth welds W1–W3, typical ranges 1.0–1.8)

**Pipeline (SME2) calculations:**
- `ai-initiatives/demo/calc_pipeline_wall_thickness.md` — DNV-OS-F101 pressure containment,
  collapse, propagation buckling; all 3 limit states
- `ai-initiatives/demo/calc_pipeline_stability.md` — DNV-RP-F109 absolute lateral stability
  screening: Froude scaled approach, soil friction
- `ai-initiatives/demo/calc_ffs_b31g_corroded.md` — ASME B31G / modified B31G (RSTRENG)
  remaining strength ratio; MAOP de-rating; corrosion growth projection

### Day 3 — OrcaFlex Output Processing + Document Generation

**OrcaFlex output parser prompts:**
- `ai-initiatives/demo/orcaflex_ascii_parser.md` — prompt template for extracting
  max/min tensions, curvature, bending moment from ASCII result files; envelope across
  load cases; sample input/output pair showing the expected format

**Document generation templates:**
- `ai-initiatives/demo/calc_memo_template.md` — structured calculation memo:
  project info, design basis, methodology, inputs, steps, results, code refs, conclusion
- `ai-initiatives/demo/sow_template.md` — scope of work auto-generator:
  input project parameters → structured SOW with standard deliverables list
- `ai-initiatives/demo/technical_query_template.md` — formatted client/internal Q&A record

## Why

The calculation templates are the most credibility-building part of the demo — they show
AI performing actual engineering work (not just lookups). Structured templates with
formula → substitution → result format are more trustworthy and verifiable than prose.
The OrcaFlex parser directly addresses the biggest time sink: extracting and summarizing
simulation output data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 4 rigid jumper calculation templates created with worked examples
- [ ] 3 pipeline calculation templates created with worked examples
- [ ] FFS templates for both disciplines (wall loss, B31G) with sample numbers
- [ ] OrcaFlex ASCII parser prompt with sample 10-line input → summary table output
- [ ] 3 document generation templates (calc memo, SOW, technical query)
- [ ] Each calculation template validated against hand-check for a sample input
- [ ] No client-specific project numbers or proprietary data in any template
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Agentic AI Horizon

Medium fit for Codex: calculation templates are structured markdown with formulas.
Codex can draft, Claude validates accuracy. OrcaFlex templates require engineering
domain knowledge — Claude review essential before finalizing.
