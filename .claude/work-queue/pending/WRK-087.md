## Description

Reflect state shows average test coverage at 20% across 7 repos, with 6 below the 80% target. This is the only **fail** severity item in the reflect checklist.

## Tasks

- [ ] Identify which repos have coverage tracking and their current percentages
- [ ] Prioritize repos by activity level and production criticality
- [ ] Add test infrastructure (pytest, coverage config) to repos missing it
- [ ] Write tests for critical paths in top 3 priority repos
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting in CI

## Context

Identified during reflect review on 2026-02-03. TDD is mandatory per workspace rules — this is a foundational gap.
