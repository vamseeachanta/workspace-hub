# digitalmodel Test Coverage Improvement

## What
Improve test coverage for the digitalmodel repository from the current 2.7% to 80%+. The repo has 83K lines and 4064 test files that exist but fail to cover the source code properly.

## Why
At 2.7% coverage, the digitalmodel codebase has virtually no safety net for regressions. The test files exist but do not properly import or exercise the digitalmodel package, meaning refactoring and new features carry high risk.

## Current State
- **Coverage**: 2.7%
- **Source size**: ~83K lines
- **Test files**: 4064 (exist but don't cover source)
- **Root cause**: Test collection does not import the digitalmodel package correctly

## Strategy
1. Fix test collection to properly import the digitalmodel package
2. Prioritize coverage for critical packages: orcaflex, fatigue, marine, signal
3. Add integration tests for core workflows
4. Ensure pytest discovers and runs all existing test files against source

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test collection fixed to import digitalmodel package
- [ ] Coverage for orcaflex package reaches 80%+
- [ ] Coverage for fatigue package reaches 80%+
- [ ] Coverage for marine package reaches 80%+
- [ ] Coverage for signal package reaches 80%+
- [ ] Overall repository coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] CI pipeline reports coverage on every PR

## Notes
- Large codebase -- prioritize packages by business criticality
- Existing test files may need path/import fixes rather than rewriting from scratch
