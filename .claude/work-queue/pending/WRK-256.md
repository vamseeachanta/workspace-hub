# Unified parametric study coordinator — orchestrate OrcaFlex, wall thickness, and fatigue sweeps

## What
Create a unified parametric study coordinator that can run Cartesian sweeps across OrcaFlex models (WRK-032 campaign generator), wall thickness/utilisation (WRK-158 parametric engine), and fatigue parameters (WRK-245 fatigue skill). Agents orchestrate a full engineering study with one invocation specifying the study type and parameter ranges.

## Why
Parametric study infrastructure exists across three separate systems (campaign, wall thickness, fatigue) but they are disconnected. A unified coordinator would enable full end-to-end parametric engineering studies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Coordinator accepts study type and parameter ranges as input
- [ ] Dispatches to the correct engine (OrcaFlex campaign, wall thickness sweep, fatigue sweep)
- [ ] Aggregates results into a unified report
- [ ] WRK-241 (pipeline integrity) and WRK-245 (fatigue skill) must be complete before full activation
- [ ] Tested with a combined wall thickness + fatigue parameter sweep

## Agentic AI Horizon
- High-value capability for engineering study automation — agents can run multi-domain parameter sweeps from a single invocation
- Blocked by WRK-241 and WRK-245; coordinator interface can be designed now
- **Disposition: groundwork now** (design coordinator interface and dispatch logic); execute after WRK-241 and WRK-245 ship
