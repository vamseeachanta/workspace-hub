# Unified parametric study coordinator — orchestrate OrcaFlex, wall thickness, and fatigue sweeps

## What
Create a unified parametric study coordinator that can run Cartesian sweeps across OrcaFlex models (WRK-032 campaign generator), wall thickness/utilisation (WRK-158 parametric engine), and fatigue parameters (WRK-245 fatigue skill). Agents orchestrate a full engineering study with one invocation specifying the study type and parameter ranges.

## Why
Parametric study infrastructure exists across three separate systems (campaign, wall thickness, fatigue) but they are disconnected. A unified coordinator would enable full end-to-end parametric engineering studies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Coordinator accepts study type and parameter ranges as input
- [x] Dispatches to the correct engine (wall thickness sweep, fatigue sweep); OrcaFlex live path deferred (licence required on licensed workstation)
- [x] Aggregates results into a unified report
- [x] WRK-241 (pipeline integrity) and WRK-245 (fatigue skill) are now complete — blockers cleared
- [x] Tested with a combined wall thickness + fatigue parameter sweep

## Implementation Notes (2026-02-24)
- Module: `digitalmodel/src/digitalmodel/structural/parametric_coordinator.py`
- Tests: `digitalmodel/tests/test_parametric_coordinator.py` — 46 tests, all passing
- OrcaFlex engine stubbed via `OrcaFlexUnavailableError` on ace-linux-1 (no OrcFxAPI licence)
- OrcaFlex live path compiled but gated by `ORCAFLEX_AVAILABLE` flag
- Cross-review: Gemini APPROVE (P3 minor CSS issue addressed in refactor); Codex NO_OUTPUT
- Legal scan: new file clean; pre-existing `sanitize_s7_models.py` BLOCK violations unchanged
- Remaining 5%: run on licensed OrcaFlex workstation to exercise live campaign path

## Agentic AI Horizon
- High-value capability for engineering study automation — agents can run multi-domain parameter sweeps from a single invocation
- Blocked by WRK-241 and WRK-245; coordinator interface can be designed now
- **Disposition: groundwork now** (design coordinator interface and dispatch logic); execute after WRK-241 and WRK-245 ship
