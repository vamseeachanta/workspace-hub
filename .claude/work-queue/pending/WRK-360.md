# Extract contractor contact data + build offshore contractor BD call list

## Context

WRK-357/358 built a vessel fleet database with current status. Every contractor header
in the 2011 pipelay and 2010 heavy-lift Offshore Magazine posters contains contact name,
title, phone, fax, email, and website — this data was parsed but discarded during
extraction. Recovering it gives ACE Engineer a ready-made BD call list filtered by
vessel capability and operating region.

Key business insight: smaller GOM anchor-barge contractors (Bisso, Chet Morrison,
Crossmar, OSFI, etc.) are reachable and represent potential scope for shallow-water
pipeline installation / hook-up / heavy-lift support work.

## What

### Phase 1 — Re-extract contractor contact info from poster PDFs

Modify or extend `src/vessel_extraction.py` to capture contractor header fields:
- `contact_name` (person name + title from header line)
- `contact_email`
- `contact_phone`
- `contact_website`

Add these columns to:
- `data/processed/vessel-fleet/pipelay-contractors-current.csv`
- `data/processed/vessel-fleet/heavy-lift-vessels-current.csv`

### Phase 2 — Online verification of active GOM contractors

For each contractor where at least one vessel is `current_status=active` AND
`operating_region` includes GOM or Gulf of Mexico:
1. Verify current website is live
2. Find current contact (LinkedIn, company website — contact page)
3. Note any ownership changes (e.g. Bisso acquisitions since 2011)
4. Flag if company has ceased operations (bankrupt, liquidated, acquired)

Priority contractors (known active GOM):
- Bisso Marine Company
- Chet Morrison Contractors
- Crossmar Inc. (Cross Group)
- Offshore Specialty Fabricators (OSFI)
- Cal Dive — SKIP (bankrupt 2015)
- Swiber — SKIP (liquidated 2016)

### Phase 3 — BD call list output

Produce `frontierdeepwater/data/processed/bd-targets/offshore-contractor-targets.csv`:

```
contractor, primary_contact, title, email, phone, website,
vessel_count, vessel_types,       # comma-separated types
operating_regions,                # GOM | Gulf | Worldwide etc.
max_crane_capacity_t,             # from vessel data
max_water_depth_ft,               # from vessel data
current_status,                   # active | inactive | unknown
contact_verified_year,
contact_source,                   # poster-2011 | website-2026 | linkedin
bd_priority,                      # A | B | C
notes
```

BD priority logic:
- **A**: Active, GOM/Gulf, verified contact 2024-2026, vessels match ACE capability areas
- **B**: Active, verified contact but non-GOM or contact not updated since 2011
- **C**: Active but unverified contact, or international only

### Phase 4 — GTM document

Produce `frontierdeepwater/docs/gtm-offshore-contractors-2026.md` — see GTM outline
in WRK-360 notes below.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Contact columns added to both *-current.csv files
- [ ] Active GOM contractors verified online (website live, contact current)
- [ ] offshore-contractor-targets.csv produced with BD priority ratings
- [ ] gtm-offshore-contractors-2026.md produced (see GTM outline)
- [ ] All committed to frontierdeepwater + hub pointer updated

## GTM Outline (for Phase 4 document)

### 1. Target segments

| Segment | Criteria | Est. count | ACE value prop |
|---------|----------|------------|----------------|
| GOM shallow-water pipelay | Anchor barge, <500ft WD, GOM region | ~12 contractors | Pipeline installation analysis, burial design, mooring studies |
| GOM deepwater construction | DP2/DP3, >1000ft WD, GOM | ~8 contractors | Riser analysis, OrcaFlex modelling, structural checks |
| International heavy lift | Crane capacity >500t, worldwide | ~15 contractors | Lift feasibility, DAF studies, structural pad design |
| SURF / umbilical lay | Reel lay / flex lay | ~10 contractors | Flexible riser design, fatigue analysis |

### 2. Value proposition by segment

- **Pipelay / installation contractors**: Independent engineering verification of
  installation analyses, on-call OrcaFlex modelling for new pipe sizes / water depths,
  burial feasibility studies. Particularly valuable for smaller contractors who don't
  maintain in-house analysis capability.

- **Heavy lift contractors**: Lift study packages (DAF, rigging, structural pad),
  independent verification of contractor-produced lift plans, crane load chart
  digitisation.

- **Both**: IMO-keyed vessel database + engineering parameter library (WRK-359 output)
  enables fast turnaround quotes — "we already have your vessel's parameters loaded."

### 3. Outreach sequence

1. Warm intro email referencing vessel name + specific capability (shows homework done)
2. Follow-up with 1-page capability summary relevant to their fleet
3. Offer: free quick-look feasibility check on a scope they're currently bidding

### 4. Quick wins (first 90 days)

- GOM shallow-water contractors: Bisso, Chet Morrison, Crossmar — known contacts,
  active fleet, straightforward scope
- Any contractor with stacked vessels considering reactivation — engineering support
  for re-certification / capability extension studies

### 5. Metrics

- Contractors contacted: target 20 in first 90 days
- Response rate target: 25%
- Meetings / calls booked: 5
- Proposals issued: 2

## Notes

- Do NOT use 2011 poster contact details for outreach without first verifying online
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator is the best tool for finding current contacts at smaller
  marine contractors
- Chet Morrison and Bisso are both Houma LA based — a single visit could cover both
