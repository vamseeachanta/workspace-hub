# Drilling Technology Evolution — MPD Adoption Case Study

## Context

> "MPD isn't new, but the implementation of it on drillships is becoming a must-have. If your rig isn't running it, you're going to get left behind."

Technology adoption in offshore drilling follows a recognizable pattern. Cyberbase in the mid-2000s is the clearest precedent: you didn't get priced out overnight, but slowly, you became less valuable. There was still space, just less of it. MPD is following the same curve right now.

## What

A data-backed content piece for aceengineer-website that tells the MPD adoption story through the lens of rig fleet data and industry evolution:

### Narrative Arc

1. **The pattern** — Technology adoption in offshore drilling isn't sudden. It's a slow squeeze. Cyberbase (mid-2000s) as the reference case.
2. **MPD today** — Every new-build drillship is being fitted. Operators are requiring it. Wells that were undrillable are now possible.
3. **The fleet data** — Use worldenergydata rig fleet (2,268 rigs) to show:
   - What fraction of active drillships have MPD installed
   - New-build vs retrofit trends
   - Contractor positioning (who's ahead, who's catching up)
4. **The engineering case** — Narrow-margin wells, HPHT, depleted reservoirs, managed-pressure cementing. Where MPD changes the risk calculus.
5. **The people case** — "Your tenth well control doesn't feel like your first." Experience compounds. But new systems require new learning. The industry's combined training investment in MPD across ADs, Drillers, Toolpushers, OIMs, Client Reps — all learning the same system.
6. **What it means** — For drilling engineers, rig owners, and operators. Position or be positioned.

### Data Visualization

- **Rig fleet MPD adoption curve** — timeline chart showing MPD-fitted rigs as % of active floater fleet (requires WRK-168 MPD flag data)
- **Contractor MPD readiness** — bar chart comparing major drillers' MPD-capable fleet share
- **Well complexity trend** — BSEE data showing increasing water depth, tighter pressure windows over time

### Content Format

- Long-form article (1,500-2,000 words) for aceengineer-website blog
- 3-4 data visualizations (Plotly interactive HTML)
- Shareable on LinkedIn for GTM visibility

## Why

- **GTM content**: Positions A&CE as practitioners who understand the operational reality, not just analysts. The voice is "I've been on the rig floor" — that's the differentiator.
- **Data showcase**: Demonstrates worldenergydata rig fleet capabilities to potential clients
- **SEO/visibility**: "MPD adoption drillship" is an underserved content niche — most content is vendor marketing, not engineering analysis
- **Supports WRK-146**: Website overhaul needs content that demonstrates domain expertise

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Article draft (1,500-2,000 words) with practitioner voice
- [ ] At least 3 data visualizations from rig fleet data
- [ ] MPD adoption timeline with contractor breakdown
- [ ] Published to aceengineer-website blog section
- [ ] LinkedIn-ready summary version
- [ ] Cross-references WRK-168 (MPD module) for technical depth

## Dependencies

- WRK-168 (MPD fleet data) should be started first to populate the MPD capability flags
- Rig fleet data already available (WRK-104/135)
- Post-training insights from Houston Safekick course will enrich the practitioner voice
