# Rerun lower tertiary analysis with latest/updated BSEE data

## What
After confirming repeatability (WRK-009), rerun the lower tertiary field analysis using the latest/updated BSEE data. Prepare updated lower tertiary results and validate correctness by comparing against historical results.

## Why
Updated data may include new production records, revised figures, or additional fields. The updated results need to be validated against historical baselines to ensure correctness and catch any data anomalies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Obtain latest/updated BSEE data for lower tertiary fields
- [ ] Rerun the analysis pipeline with updated data
- [ ] Prepare lower tertiary results output
- [ ] Compare against historical results for correctness checks
- [ ] Flag any significant deviations with explanations
- [ ] Document data vintage and any changes from rev30 inputs
