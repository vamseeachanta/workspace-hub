# Integrate gmsh Meshing Skill into digitalmodel and Solver Pipelines

## What
Create integration pathways so the gmsh meshing skill (WRK-139) is actively used by other programs in the workspace — specifically the digitalmodel diffraction/hydrodynamic analysis pipelines, AQWA runner, OrcaWave workflows, and BEMRosetta mesh conversion.

## Why
The gmsh skill (WRK-139) documents how to use gmsh standalone, but it needs to be wired into the actual analysis programs so users can generate meshes programmatically as part of end-to-end workflows (spec → mesh → solver → results).

## Scope

### Integration points to plan:
1. **digitalmodel mesh generation module** — Python API calls to gmsh for creating box barge, cylinder, and hull meshes from spec.yml geometry definitions
2. **AQWA runner** — gmsh → AQWA .DAT mesh conversion as a pre-processing step
3. **OrcaWave workflows** — gmsh → GDF export for OrcaWave diffraction input
4. **BEMRosetta pipeline** — gmsh MSH v2.2 → Nemoh/BEMRosetta mesh format conversion
5. **CLI entry point** — `digitalmodel mesh generate` command using gmsh backend
6. **Existing cad-mesh-generation skill** — cross-reference and delegate to gmsh-meshing for gmsh-specific operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Map all integration points between gmsh and existing solver pipelines
- [ ] Design Python module interface for gmsh mesh generation from spec.yml
- [ ] Plan AQWA .DAT export pathway (gmsh → panel data → AQWA input)
- [ ] Plan OrcaWave GDF export pathway (gmsh → GDF → OrcaWave input)
- [ ] Plan BEMRosetta MSH conversion pathway
- [ ] Define CLI commands for mesh generation workflows
- [ ] Document integration architecture in a plan/spec
