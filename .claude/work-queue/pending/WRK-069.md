# Acquire USCG MISLE bulk dataset

## What
Download the full USCG MISLE_DATA.zip from USCG Homeport (contains marine casualty and pollution data 2002-2015). Import using the existing MISLE importer in the marine_safety module.

## Why
Currently only 16 sample records exist. Bulk file contains ~200K+ marine casualties.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Download MISLE_DATA.zip from USCG Homeport
- [ ] Extract and validate data files
- [ ] Import using existing misle_importer.py
- [ ] Document record counts and date ranges
- [ ] Verify data appears in marine_safety database

## Plan
- **Files**: `src/worldenergydata/marine_safety/acquirers/uscg_misle_acquirer.py`, `src/worldenergydata/marine_safety/importers/misle_importer.py`
- **Step 1**: Identify the tax year/data period for the MISLE dataset. Manually download `MISLE_DATA.zip` from USCG Homeport via browser (HTTP 403 blocks scripts)
- **Step 2**: Place ZIP in `data/modules/marine_safety/raw/uscg/` and extract
- **Step 3**: Run existing `misle_importer.py` against extracted CSV/data files
- **Step 4**: Validate record counts (~200K+ expected) and date range (2002-2015)
- **Step 5**: Update `acquisition_manifest.json` with download date and record counts
- **Verify**: Confirm data loads via marine_safety loader; run existing tests

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: APPROVE | Codex: APPROVE | Gemini: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - Corrected file paths to full subpaths (`acquirers/uscg_misle_acquirer.py`, `importers/misle_importer.py`)
  - Added checksum/file-size validation suggestion (Codex) — implicit in Step 4 record count validation

## Progress
- 2026-02-01: Acquirer code built (uscg_misle_acquirer.py). USCG Homeport returns HTTP 403 to automated scripts. Manual browser download required — see acquisition_manifest.json for instructions. Refresh script: scripts/refresh_uscg_misle.sh.
