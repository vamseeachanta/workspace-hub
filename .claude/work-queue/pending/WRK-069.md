# Acquire USCG MISLE bulk dataset

## What
Download the full USCG MISLE_DATA.zip from USCG Homeport (contains marine casualty and pollution data 2002-2015). Import using the existing MISLE importer in the marine_safety module.

## Why
Currently only 16 sample records exist. Bulk file contains ~200K+ marine casualties.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Download MISLE_DATA.zip from USCG Homeport
- [ ] Extract and validate data files
- [ ] Import using existing misle_importer.py
- [ ] Document record counts and date ranges
- [ ] Verify data appears in marine_safety database

## Progress
- 2026-02-01: Acquirer code built (uscg_misle_acquirer.py). USCG Homeport returns HTTP 403 to automated scripts. Manual browser download required — see acquisition_manifest.json for instructions. Refresh script: scripts/refresh_uscg_misle.sh.
