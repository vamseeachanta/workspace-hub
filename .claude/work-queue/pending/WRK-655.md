# feat(skills): Define Resource Intelligence Skill and Validator-Ready Stage Contract

## Problem

`Resource Intelligence` is now part of the canonical `WRK-624` workflow, but it is
still the loosest stage in practice:

- the stage is described in policy, but not yet operationalized through a dedicated skill
- its artifact contract is not yet validator-checkable end to end
- repo context, document intelligence, legal scan, prior learnings, and skill routing
  are known concepts, but not yet presented as one defined workflow
- relevant online codes, standards, and documents are not yet systematically downloaded, documented, and placed in durable reference locations
- user review of stage gaps is not yet backed by a reusable ecosystem skill

Without a first-class skill, the stage risks degenerating into inconsistent, ad hoc
research notes that vary by agent and session.

## What

Create or enhance the ecosystem so `Resource Intelligence` becomes a defined, reusable
skill-driven stage.

### Scope

1. **Create or enhance a dedicated Resource Intelligence skill**
   - canonical path under `.claude/skills/`
   - clear trigger conditions
   - minimal but reusable workflow
   - explicit artifact outputs for the WRK resource pack

2. **Define the stage knowledge map**
   - repo lifecycle wrapper
   - domain context loader
   - repo/document inventory
   - document intelligence / indexing
   - prior knowledge surfacing
   - legal scan
   - agent-fit and quota awareness
   - deep-learning handoff

3. **Define the stage gap model**
   - `P1`: blocking gaps
   - `P2`: material but non-blocking gaps
   - `P3`: enhancement gaps
   - explicit rule:
     - surface `P1` gaps to user first
     - pause for user when unresolved `P1` gaps remain
     - continue when no `P1` gaps remain

4. **Make the stage validator-ready**
   - define minimum artifact presence rules
   - define minimum content/section rules
   - define legal-scan proof location
   - define how document-intelligence indexing is recorded

5. **Update workflow references**
  - `WRK-624` spec and HTML should point to the new skill and stage contract
  - recommended-next-work section should reflect the new stage capability
6. **Increase long-term intelligence value**
   - relevant online codes, standards, and documents should be downloaded where allowed
   - documented in document intelligence
   - placed in the relevant reference location for future reuse
   - used to compound repository intelligence over time

## Knowledge Map to Support This WRK

| Role | Skill / System | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle wrapper | `work-queue` | Align stage artifacts to WRK lifecycle |
| Domain scoping | `engineering-context-loader` | Narrow relevant domain context and standards |
| Repo/document scan | `document-inventory` | Inventory source collections before deeper processing |
| Document intelligence | `document-rag-pipeline` | Build searchable document context when needed |
| Prior learnings | `knowledge-manager` | Surface prior decisions, patterns, gotchas |
| Legal check | `legal-sanity` | Check resource-pack artifacts for sensitive content |
| Agent fit | `agent-router` | Help select best provider mix for later stages |
| Quota awareness | `agent-usage-optimizer` | Keep downstream claim/review work within quota |
| Deep synthesis | `comprehensive-learning` | Consume outputs later for slower ecosystem learning |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Resource Intelligence executes through a defined skill, not ad hoc instructions
- [ ] Skill defines required artifacts for `resource-pack.md`, `sources.md`, `constraints.md`, `domain-notes.md`, `open-questions.md`, and `resources.yaml`
- [ ] Skill defines a visible `P1/P2/P3` gap-ranking model
- [ ] Skill defines user-pause behavior for unresolved `P1` gaps
- [ ] Stage knowledge map is documented and easy for the user to inspect/tweak
- [ ] Validator-ready rules are documented for minimum stage completion
- [ ] `WRK-624` references are updated to point at the new skill contract
- [ ] Relevant online codes, standards, and documents are downloaded, documented in document intelligence, and placed in the appropriate long-term reference location
- [ ] The plan defines how repository intelligence should grow over time beyond raw document intelligence
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Notes

- Prefer enhancing an existing skill if one already cleanly fits the role; only create a new one if that produces a clearer ecosystem contract.
- Keep the skill concise; push detailed references into linked files where needed.
- The goal is not generic “research guidance.” The goal is a repeatable, inspectable
  stage contract that materially improves planning quality.
