# worldenergydata test structure consolidation

## What

Verify and consolidate the worldenergydata test directory structure. Confirm that all
test modules live at the correct level under `tests/unit/` without stray top-level
`modules/`, `dashboard/`, or `economics/` directories cluttering the root.

## Why

Inconsistent test directory layouts break pytest discovery and confuse agents navigating
the repo. A clean, consolidated structure ensures test discovery works correctly and
matches workspace-hub conventions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Verify `worldenergydata/tests/unit/` structure — no stray top-level dirs
- [x] Confirm pytest collection passes without errors
- [x] Structure matches workspace-hub test conventions
- [x] Findings documented (consolidation was already complete prior to this WRK)

## Findings (2026-02-24)

Verification confirmed the test structure was already correct prior to this item:
- `tests/unit/` contains module-level subdirectories as expected
- No stray `modules/`, `dashboard/`, or `economics/` directories at repo root
- pytest collection: all tests discovered correctly
- Consolidation was completed in an earlier session; this WRK verified and closed the item

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Test structure hygiene is table-stakes infrastructure for agentic code work.
- Clean test layouts enable agents to run targeted test suites without path errors.
- **Disposition: closed** — structure verified correct; no further work required.
