# assethold Test Coverage Improvement

## What
Set up test infrastructure and achieve 80%+ test coverage for the assethold repository. Currently there is no coverage data available, meaning the testing infrastructure may not be configured.

## Why
Without any coverage data, there is no visibility into code quality or regression risk. Setting up the testing infrastructure is a prerequisite for safe development and maintenance.

## Current State
- **Coverage**: No data available
- **Test infrastructure**: Not configured
- **Tests**: Unknown

## Strategy
1. Set up pytest + coverage infrastructure (pyproject.toml / setup.cfg)
2. Configure coverage reporting (coveragerc or pyproject.toml coverage section)
3. Run initial coverage baseline measurement
4. Write tests for core modules starting with highest-risk code
5. Integrate coverage into CI pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] pytest and coverage tooling configured and working
- [ ] Baseline coverage measured and documented
- [ ] Core module tests written
- [ ] Overall repository coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] CI pipeline reports coverage on every PR

## Notes
- This is a greenfield testing effort -- start with infrastructure before writing tests
- Identify the most critical code paths first to prioritize test writing
