# Field development economics — MIRR NPV with carbon cost sensitivity

## What

Extend field development economics model to include MIRR/NPV with carbon cost sensitivity.
Carbon price scenarios ($/tonne CO2), Scope 1/2 emissions intensity input, breakeven carbon
price output. Feed from existing decline curve forecasts (WRK-318).

## Why

Carbon pricing is increasingly material to field development economics. Adding carbon cost
sensitivity to NPV/MIRR analysis enables screening of development scenarios against carbon
price trajectories, supporting investment decisions that account for energy transition risk.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] NPV calculation with configurable discount rate and cash flow schedule
- [ ] MIRR (Modified Internal Rate of Return) calculation
- [ ] Carbon cost input: $/tonne CO2, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity (tCO2/boe)
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis: NPV vs. carbon price curve (tornado chart output)
- [ ] Breakeven carbon price calculation (NPV = 0 solve)
- [ ] Integration with WRK-318 decline curve forecasts for production profile input
- [ ] Pytest coverage with known economics examples
