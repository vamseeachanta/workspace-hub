## Background

No self-contained HTML report exists for OrcaWave analysis results. The OrcaFlex
reporting framework (WRK-129) covers time-domain; OrcaWave needs an equivalent
for frequency-domain diffraction outputs.

## Goal

Build a modular, config-driven HTML report generator for OrcaWave `.owr` results.
Each section is optional and controlled by a YAML config file.

## Sections (all optional)

1. Model summary (geometry, mesh stats, periods, headings)
2. RAO plots per DOF (interactive Plotly)
3. Added mass / damping matrices
4. Mean drift table + polar plot
5. Panel pressure contour (L05-style)
6. Multi-body coupling matrix (L03/L04-style)
7. QTF heatmap (L06-style)
8. QA pass/fail summary

## Entry Point

```python
from digitalmodel.orcawave.reporting import generate_orcawave_report
generate_orcawave_report(owr_path, config_yml, output_html)
```

## Module Structure

```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 8 section types implemented with toggle on/off
- [ ] L01 example produces valid HTML report with all sections
- [ ] Config YAML documented in examples folder
- [ ] Tests cover builder + each section renderer

## Restart Plan

Selected route: Route B

### Route A (Fast Validation)

- Validate existing deliverables against current acceptance criteria
- Capture only deltas and evidence gaps
- Close if all checks pass

### Route B (Full Re-run)

- Re-execute all task steps end-to-end
- Refresh outputs and evidence artifacts
- Reassess acceptance criteria with explicit checklist updates

### Planned Steps (Selected)

1. Partial progress; finish remaining report sections/tests and re-triage.
2. Record evidence paths and command outputs in this WRK entry.
3. Update status and percent_complete only after verification is complete.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Confirm required files/artifacts exist at expected paths
- [ ] Run relevant commands/tests and record results
- [ ] Verify each acceptance criterion with explicit evidence
- [ ] Document residual risks or known gaps
