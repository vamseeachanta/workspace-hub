# Finish ace-linux-2 setup — install open source engineering programs and map capabilities

## What

Complete the ace-linux-2 workstation setup by installing and configuring a full suite of open
source engineering programs: Blender, OpenFOAM, FreeCAD, Gmsh, BemRosetta, and others. Create
a capability map showing how all programs integrate with each other (file format compatibility,
workflow pipelines, import/export chains). Additionally, research open source FEA (Finite
Element Analysis) programs suitable for engineering assignments.

## Why

ace-linux-2 needs to be a fully capable engineering workstation with open source tools that
cover CAD, meshing, CFD, FEA, and visualization. Mapping capabilities ensures efficient
workflows and identifies gaps where tools complement each other.

## Target Programs

### Core Suite
| Program | Domain | Key Capability |
|---------|--------|
----------------|
| **Blender** | 3D modeling, rendering, animation | Geometry creation, visualization, Python scripting |
| **OpenFOAM** | CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) | Flow simulation, turbulence modeling |
| **FreeCAD** | Parametric CAD | Mechanical design, assembly, FEM workbench |
| **Gmsh** | Mesh generation | 2D/3D finite element mesh generation |
| **BemRosetta** | BEM (Boundary Element Method) | Hydrodynamic analysis, wave-body interaction |

### Research Required — Open Source FEA Programs
- **CalculiX** — FEA solver compatible with Abaqus input format
- **Code_Aster** / **Salome-Meca** — structural mechanics, thermal analysis
- **Elmer FEM** — multiphysics (structural, thermal, EM, fluid)
- **MOOSE Framework** — multiphysics FEA from Idaho National Lab
- **GetDP** — general finite element solver
- **PrePoMax** — pre/post processor for CalculiX (may need Wine on Linux)
- Others to be discovered during research phase

### Capability Mapping Goals
- File format compatibility matrix (STEP, IGES, STL, BREP, OpenFOAM mesh, etc.)
- Workflow pipelines: CAD → Mesh → Solve → Post-process
- Which tools can drive which others (e.g., FreeCAD → Gmsh → OpenFOAM → ParaView)
- Import/export chains and any format conversion gaps
- Python scripting/automation potential across the suite

## Split Into Sub-Items

This umbrella item has been divided into focused work items:

| Item | Title | Blocked By | Priority |
|------|-------|------------|
----------|
| **WRK-289** | Research open source FEA programs | — | High |
| **WRK-290** | Install core engineering suite (Blender, OpenFOAM, FreeCAD, Gmsh, BemRosetta) | — | High |
| **WRK-291** | Install recommended FEA programs | WRK-289 | Medium |
| **WRK-292** | Create capability map and interoperability matrix | WRK-290, WRK-291 | Medium |

**Execution order**: WRK-289 and WRK-290 can run in parallel. WRK-291 waits for research.
WRK-292 waits for all installations. This umbrella closes when all sub-items are archived.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] WRK-289 archived (FEA research complete)
- [x] WRK-290 archived (core suite installed)
- [x] WRK-291 archived (FEA programs installed)
- [x] WRK-292 archived (capability map created)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Installation can be scripted and automated — good candidate for repeatable setup scripts
- Capability mapping is a research task well suited to AI assistance
- FEA program research benefits from broad knowledge of open source ecosystem
- Future: automate workflow pipelines with Python scripting across tools
