# session-bootstrap skill — one-time historical session analysis per machine

## What

A standalone, manually-invoked skill that mines all historical sessions on the current machine to produce the initial skill scorecard. Run once per machine after WRK-231 is delivered. Every machine has its own session history and may have been used for different types of work — this skill cold-starts the skill performance tracking from real data rather than waiting for future sessions to accumulate.

## Why

Each machine in the ecosystem has accumulated session data independently. Without bootstrapping, the skill scorecard starts empty and takes weeks to build signal. Running this skill once per machine immediately surfaces which skills are underperforming, what knowledge gaps have been hit repeatedly, and what the agent has been correcting most — from day one. The skill is also a diagnostic tool: if a machine has been running for months, the bootstrap output is the first honest audit of how well skills have been serving work on that machine.

## What It Does

1. **Discovers all sessions** on the current machine — scans `~/.claude/state/sessions/` and `~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/` for all `.json` and `.jsonl` files
2. **Mines for skill signals** using the per-skill tracking defined in WRK-231: invocations, one-shot vs iteration, correction events, tool patterns, knowledge gap indicators
3. **Produces initial skill scorecard** — usage rate, one-shot rate, mean corrections, top failure modes per skill — written to `skill-registry.yaml` as baseline metrics
4. **Surfaces top findings** — top 5 underperforming skills by correction rate; top 3 knowledge gaps by recurrence; top 3 skills loaded-but-never-used (archival candidates)
5. **Creates bootstrap WRK items** — for any deep gap recurring 3+ times across sessions, spins off a WRK item automatically
6. **Stamps the machine** — writes a `bootstrap_complete` record to `.claude/state/session-analysis/bootstrap.json` with timestamp, session count analysed, and summary stats so the skill is not accidentally re-run destructively

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `.claude/skills/coordination/workspace/session-bootstrap/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Skill discovers and processes all session files on the current machine (both `.json` and `.jsonl` formats)
- [ ] Produces skill scorecard baseline in `skill-registry.yaml` (new fields: `bootstrap_sessions_analysed`, `baseline_usage_rate`, `baseline_one_shot_rate`, `baseline_mean_corrections`)
- [ ] Outputs a human-readable bootstrap report at `.claude/state/session-analysis/bootstrap-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- [ ] Auto-creates WRK items for gaps recurring 3+ times
- [ ] Idempotent — re-running after bootstrap stamps it as "already done, use `--force` to re-run"
- [ ] Works across different session formats (UUID `.json` files and dated `.jsonl` files)
- [ ] Documented run instruction: `"Run once per machine after WRK-231 is delivered"`

## Run Protocol (post-WRK-231)

After WRK-231 is delivered, run on every machine in the ecosystem:

```bash
# On each machine:
/session-bootstrap

# Check output:
cat .claude/state/session-analysis/bootstrap-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

Machines currently known to have session data:
- `ace-linux-1` (primary — 241 sessions confirmed, 12MB)
- Any other machines where Claude Code has been run

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Bootstrap is a one-time investment that pays forward permanently — once the scorecard has a baseline, every future session adds signal on top of real data
- The bootstrap skill itself is a good candidate for agentic execution — run it autonomously on each machine as part of WRK-231 delivery
- **Disposition**: do once, immediately after WRK-231 ships, on every machine
