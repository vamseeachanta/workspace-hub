# data(vessel_fleet): Populate Curated Drilling Riser + Rig Fleet Datasets

## What

Expand and supplement `data/modules/vessel_fleet/curated/` with additional
public-data rows across three datasets:

1. `drilling_riser_components.csv` — **already has 24 rows**; expand to cover
   18.75", 21", 21.5", 24" OD series from all major manufacturers
2. `drilling_rigs.csv` — **rig_fleet_full.bin already exists** (2,320 rigs, Feb 2026);
   export to CSV for human-readable reference + SODIR vessel integration
3. `construction_vessels.csv` — new file; lay vessels + heavy lift from SODIR + Equasis

## Why

`DrillingRiserLoader().filter_by_size(od_in)` works but has sparse coverage.
The OrcaFlex enrichment pipeline (WRK-595) needs to match 21" OD riser joints
from the drilling riser models — currently only 9 riser_joint rows in the CSV.
BSEE rig fleet (99 drillships) is in binary .bin — expose as queryable CSV.
`ConstructionVesselLoader` has no data — needed for S-lay vessel enrichment.

## Sources

### drilling_riser_components.csv

API STD 16F (Specification for Marine Drilling Riser Equipment) defines
standardized riser joint sizes. Supplementary public data from:
- NOV (nationaloilvarco.com) — published drill riser catalog specs
- Baker Hughes (bhge.com/oilfield) — published riser specs
- Hydril (hydril.com) — published riser specs
- API STD 16F Table 1 — nominal OD/WT/grade combinations

Schema (from existing RiserJointEntry dataclass):
```
component_id, component_type, manufacturer, model,
od_in, id_in, wall_thickness_in, length_ft,
weight_air_kips, weight_water_kips, grade,
connection_type, buoyancy_coverage_pct, buoyancy_od_in,
pressure_rating_psi, data_source, notes
```

Standard nominal sizes (API STD 16F):
- OD: 18.75", 21", 21.5", 24", 26.75" (primary series)
- WT: typically 0.875" to 1.5"
- Length: 45ft, 50ft, 55ft (standard), 10-25ft pup joints
- Grade: G105, S135 typical

### drilling_rigs.csv

Extract from existing BSEE rig_fleet_full.bin:
```python
from worldenergydata.vessel_fleet.bridge.rig_fleet_bridge import RigFleetBridge
rigs = RigFleetBridge().load()
# Columns: rig_name, rig_type, water_depth_rating_ft, owner, operator,
#          status, imo_number, flag_state, classification_society
```

### construction_vessels.csv

From SODIR API (Norwegian shelf vessel data, public):
- Vessel name, type, pipelay method, lay tension, crane capacity
- Water depth rating, DP class, flag state

## Steps

1. Extract drilling_rigs.csv from existing rig_fleet_full.bin
   (use RigFleetBridge if available, else unpickle directly)
2. Create drilling_riser_components.csv from API STD 16F + public catalogs
   - At minimum: 5 rows covering typical 21" and 18.75" joints at standard lengths
3. Create construction_vessels.csv from SODIR API for lay vessels
   - Query: `https://fact.no/` for construction vessel fleet
4. Commit to `worldenergydata/data/modules/vessel_fleet/curated/`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `drilling_riser_components.csv` ≥ 20 rows (21" and 18.75" joints, standard grades)
- [ ] `drilling_rigs.csv` populated from BSEE data (rig name, type, water depth rating)
- [ ] `construction_vessels.csv` ≥ 10 rows (lay vessels + heavy lift)
- [ ] `DrillingRiserLoader().query(component_type="riser_joint")` returns non-empty df
- [ ] Tests pass
