# Set Up aceengineer-strategy Private Repo

## What
Create a private GitHub repo `aceengineer-strategy` that mirrors the engineering orchestration pattern (workspace-hub → agents → work items → review gates) for business strategy, GTM execution, and pipeline management. Same discipline, different problem domain.

## Why
Vamsee already solved the engineering execution problem with agent orchestration, work queues, and review gates. The business side needs the same structure but with a privacy wall. Engineering repos (public) and business repo (private) must stay completely separate — no cross-references, no symlinks.

## Key Frameworks

### Weekly Scorecard (5 numbers, every Friday)
- Prospects contacted
- Conversations had
- Proposals sent
- Revenue closed ($)
- Pipeline value ($)

### Experiment Framework
Every business move is a documented experiment with hypothesis, method, success criteria, duration, results, and learnings.

### Strategy Reviewer Agent
Challenges every plan: "What's the evidence?", "What's the cheapest test?", "Are you avoiding the phone again?"

### Lost Deals File
Post-mortem on every deal that didn't close — why, what objection, what to do differently. This is where real market intelligence accumulates.

## Privacy Architecture
- **Private repo** on GitHub — same tooling, invisible to public
- `.gitignore` contact details and PII
- Engineering repos (public) and business repo (private) stay completely separate
- No cross-references, no symlinks between them
- Secrets management: prospect contact info, pricing, deal terms never in commit messages

## Plan

**Target**: New private GitHub repo `aceengineer-strategy`

### Phase 1 — Create Repo & Structure
- `gh repo create aceengineer-strategy --private`
- Create directory tree as specified in ## Repo Structure
- Add `.gitignore` (exclude PII, contact details, pricing specifics)
- Add `README.md` with repo purpose and navigation

### Phase 2 — CLAUDE.md & Agent Definitions
- Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with business strategy orchestrator rules
- Create 5 agent definitions: market-analyst, outbound-agent, pricing-analyst, content-strategist, strategy-reviewer
- Create 3 workflow definitions: prospect-pipeline, quarterly-review, experiment-cycle

### Phase 3 — Strategy Documents
- Seed `strategy/positioning.md` from Feb 15-16 session notes (WRK-146 strategic positioning section)
- Seed `strategy/ideal-customer.md` from GTM strategy (mid-market offshore, 10-50 engineers)
- Seed `strategy/competitors.md` from WRK-148 comparable companies (Cognite, Akselos, Palantir)
- Seed `strategy/pricing-model.md` with $120K retainer model
- Seed `strategy/go-to-market.md` from WRK-148 priority action matrix

### Phase 4 — Pipeline & Experiments
- Create `pipeline/prospects.md` with 20 target companies from WRK-148
- Create `pipeline/lost-deals.md` template
- Create `experiments/TEMPLATE.md`
- Create first experiment: "LinkedIn content series — AI automation for OrcaFlex"

### Phase 5 — Metrics & Content
- Create `metrics/weekly-scorecard.md` template (5 numbers)
- Create `content/blog-to-sales-map.md` mapping existing blog posts to ICP pain points

### Dependencies
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for repo creation
- Content from WRK-148 assets (ace-gtm-strategy PDF)
- No code dependencies

## Go-to-Market Priorities (from strategy session)
1. Reposition website (WRK-146)
2. Build outbound pipeline — target mid-market offshore engineering firms (10-50 engineers), 3-5 retainers at $120K
3. Package open-source play — 221 S-N curve library as public Python package
4. Pursue Anthropic intro (WRK-142) — costs nothing, high upside

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Private repo created on GitHub
- [ ] .claude/ directory with CLAUDE.md, 5 agent definitions, 3 workflow definitions
- [ ] strategy/ directory with positioning, ICP, competitors, pricing, GTM documents
- [ ] pipeline/ directory with prospects template and lost-deals template
- [ ] experiments/ directory with TEMPLATE.md and at least 1 active experiment
- [ ] metrics/ directory with weekly scorecard template
- [ ] content/ directory with blog-to-sales-map seeded from existing blog posts
- [ ] All templates populated with real content from the Feb 15-16 strategy session

## Agentic AI Horizon

- aceengineer-strategy private repo and business operations framework is foundational for coordinating the go-to-market activities — agents need a structured operations context to act in.
- Business strategy documentation benefits from human direction; agents can populate templates and maintain the framework once it exists.
- **Disposition: invest now** — a structured operations framework enables agents to maintain business intelligence autonomously; without it, all business context lives in unstructured docs.
