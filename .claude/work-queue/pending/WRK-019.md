# Establish drilling, completion, and intervention cost data by region and environment

## What
Build a cost data layer on top of the field data pipelines that provides drilling, completion, and intervention cost estimates segmented by:
- **Environment**: offshore vs. onshore
- **Region**: Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Brazil, Mexico, Texas (RRC), etc.
- **Activity type**: drilling (by well type/depth), completion (by type), intervention (by workover type)
- **Water depth / well depth bands** for offshore

Sources may include public cost indices, IHS/Rystad benchmarks (where available), BSEE/regulatory filings, and derived estimates from duration-based proxies (rig day rates × activity duration).

## Why
Cost data transforms activity analysis from descriptive to economically meaningful. Clients need cost context to evaluate field economics, benchmark operations, and make investment decisions. Without cost, activity counts alone don't convey operational burden.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify available public and derivable cost data sources
- [ ] Define cost categories: drilling cost, completion cost, intervention cost
- [ ] Segment costs by offshore vs. onshore, region, water depth, well depth
- [ ] Implement cost estimation methodology (direct data where available, proxy-based where not)
- [ ] Integrate cost layer with field data pipeline outputs
- [ ] Produce cost summaries per field, lease, or region query
- [ ] Cross-regional cost benchmarking capability
- [ ] Document data sources, methodology, assumptions, and confidence levels
- [ ] Validate against published industry cost benchmarks where available
