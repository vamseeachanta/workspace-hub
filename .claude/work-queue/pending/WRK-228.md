# WRK-228: Cross-machine terminal UX consistency

## Problem

The Windows 11 / Git Bash experience is inconsistent with Linux terminal for day-to-day
Claude Code sessions. Key friction points identified:

| Behaviour | Windows (current) | Linux (target) |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Submit prompt | Ctrl+Enter | Alt+Enter |
| Next tab | Alt+Tab (OS-level) | Terminal-native |
| Copy text to Claude | Manual workaround | Seamless |
| Paste image into Claude | Broken / unclear | Works natively |
| Screenshot → Claude | Folder not always accessible | Auto-accessible |
| Chrome Claude extension | Ad-hoc setup per machine | Consistent, always running |
| Work item HTML output | Not closed — no QA loop | HTML report per work item |

## Goals

1. Make keyboard shortcuts consistent across Windows Git Bash and Linux terminals
2. Ensure screenshot folder is always accessible to Claude (auto-mount / env var)
3. Standardise Chrome Claude extension setup across all machines
4. **Every work item** generates a paired HTML output for input/output/QA closure
5. Long-run: capture user session behaviour patterns to maintain consistency

## Scope

- Machines: ACMA-ANSYS05 (Windows), ace-linux-1, aceengineer-01, any future nodes
- Terminals: Windows Terminal + Git Bash, Linux bash/zsh, SSH sessions
- Tools in scope: Claude Code CLI, Chrome Claude extension, terminal emulators

## Phase 1: Analysis (before implementation)

Run analysis on each machine before making changes:

1. **Audit current keybindings** — `~/.claude/keybindings.json` on each machine
2. **Audit terminal emulator config** — Windows Terminal profiles, Linux .bashrc/.zshrc
3. **Screenshot folder** — current path on each machine, accessibility to Claude
4. **Chrome extension** — installed? version? which profile?
5. **Session behaviour mining** — review session logs for friction events (wrong key, paste fail, etc.)

Deliverable: `specs/modules/terminal-ux/cross-machine-audit.md` before any changes

## Phase 2: Standardisation

Based on audit:
- Unify keybindings in `~/.claude/keybindings.json` (use `keybindings-help` skill)
- Configure screenshot folder as `CLAUDE_SCREENSHOT_DIR` env var on all machines
- Chrome extension: document install/config steps in `admin/it/chrome-claude-setup.md`
- HTML output template per work item — define standard in WRK-229

## Readiness Integration

- Add cross-machine UX consistency check to `ensure-readiness.sh`
- Flag if keybindings.json is missing or screenshot folder unreachable
- Flag if Chrome extension not detected (via extension check script)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit doc complete for all active machines
- [ ] Keybindings consistent (Ctrl+Enter = submit on all machines)
- [ ] Screenshot folder accessible to Claude on all machines
- [ ] Chrome extension installed and configured consistently
- [ ] `ensure-readiness.sh` includes UX consistency checks
- [ ] At least 1 work item demonstrates full HTML QA loop closure

## Notes

- Analysis must happen across machines BEFORE any implementation
- User sessions are the ground truth for what shortcuts matter most
- WRK-229 (AI agent QA loop) is a complementary item — HTML output standard shared
