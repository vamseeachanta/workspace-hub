# WRK-209: uv Enforcement Across Workspace

## What

Replace all `python3`/`python` detection chains in workspace-hub scripts with
`uv run --no-project python`. uv is the declared workspace tool manager and is
already required by `check-encoding.sh`, but many older scripts still use
multi-fallback detection (`python3 || python || error`). This creates silent
incompatibilities across Windows/Linux machines.

## Why

**Session trigger (2026-02-19)**: While writing `check-encoding.sh`, the
initial version used `python3`/`python` fallback detection. User feedback:
"should this not be flowing through uv" and "The solutions are not high
level.. one shot.. Too much intertwined." The clean solution: `uv` is a hard
dependency, not optional — if it's not installed, fail clearly with an
install instruction.

`uv run --no-project python` solves:
- `python3` vs `python` naming difference (Windows vs Linux)
- No system Python required — uv manages its own Python
- No virtual environment activation needed
- Consistent version across all machines

## Scope

### Files to audit and fix

| File | Current pattern | Fix |
|------|----------------|-----|
| `scripts/operations/setup-hooks.sh` | `python3 \|\| python` detection | Remove; uv check already in check-encoding.sh |
| `scripts/data/og-standards/rag.py` | Invoked as `python3 rag.py` | Add `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run python` shebang |
| `scripts/development/ai-workflow/*.sh` | Any `python3` calls | Replace with `uv run --no-project python` |
| `scripts/improve/improve.sh` | Any `python3` calls | Replace with `uv run --no-project python` |
| `scripts/work-queue/*.py` | `python3 script.py` invocations | Replace with `uv run --no-project python script.py` |
| `CLAUDE.md` memory | "System python3 (3.12.3)" note | Update to "uv manages Python — use uv run" |

### Hub-level pyproject.toml

Add a minimal `pyproject.toml` at workspace-hub root declaring:
- `requires-python = ">=3.12"`
- `tool.uv` section pinning Python version
This allows `uv run python` (without `--no-project`) at hub root while
preserving `--no-project` for hook invocations from arbitrary working dirs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All hub scripts that invoke Python use `uv run` (no `python3`/`python` chains)
- [ ] `setup-hooks.sh` Step 4 checks `uv` availability instead of `python3`
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` added at workspace-hub root (minimal — Python version pin only)
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` memory updated: "uv is required; use `uv run` for all Python invocations"
- [ ] At least one script (e.g., `generate-index.py`) invocable as `uv run python scripts/work-queue/generate-index.py`

## Plan

Route B — inline plan. Requires Codex/Gemini cross-review before execution
(affects many scripts across the workspace).

**Sequence**:
1. Audit all scripts for `python3`/`python` patterns (Grep scan)
2. Fix `setup-hooks.sh` — remove python3 check, it's now redundant (uv check covers it)
3. Add hub-level `pyproject.toml` (minimal)
4. Fix remaining scripts in bulk (`sed` replacements where straightforward)
5. Update `CLAUDE.md` memory note

*Awaiting `plan_reviewed: true` — needs Codex/Gemini cross-review.*
