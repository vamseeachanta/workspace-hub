# Hardware Consolidation

## What
Inventory, assess, and consolidate all available hardware into a coherent plan for repurposing, upgrading, or retiring each device. Build a cross-platform hardware assessment script (Windows + Linux) to automate data collection. Additionally, set up per-machine dev environment readiness: agent CLI health checks, terminal configuration, repo/submodule work assignments, and domain tool maintenance — all automated via shell startup hooks.

## Why
Multiple devices are sitting idle or underutilized. A systematic inventory and assessment identifies what can be repurposed (homelab, NAS, dev workstation, GPU compute) vs. what should be retired or recycled. Once machines are assigned roles, each needs a frictionless dev environment: agent CLIs verified, terminal starting in the right place, correct repos cloned, and domain tools up-to-date. Without this, every new terminal session wastes time on setup and troubleshooting.

## Hardware Inventory

### AceEngineer Computers (3x)

*Mapped from `aceengineer-admin/admin/hardware.md` — AceEngineer-01/02/03*

### Storage
- Old external hard drives (mix of working and non-working) — need assessment
- 2x 4 TB spinning hard drives (used) — need SMART health check
- 1x Samsung 870 EVO 500 GB SATA 2.5" SSD (spare) — **candidate for AceEngineer-02** (same 2.5" SATA form factor as AceEngineer-01; compatible with Z10PE-D16; verify free bay when assessing AE-02)

### Printers
- 1x HP printer — model TBD
- 1x Epson printer — model TBD

### Networking Equipment
- 1x Main router — model/specs TBD, run assessment
- 1x Small router — model/specs TBD, run assessment

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Assessment Script
- [x] Cross-platform script (handles Windows via PowerShell + Linux via Bash)
- [x] Collects: CPU model/cores/speed, RAM size/type, GPU model/VRAM, storage devices/capacity/health, motherboard model, network interfaces, OS version
- [x] Output: structured JSON or YAML for easy comparison
- [x] External drive health check (SMART data where available)
- [x] Portable — runs without installing additional software (or minimal deps)

### Phase 2: Inventory
- [~] Run script on all 3 old PCs (AE-01 done 2026-02-02, AE-02 done 2026-02-21, AE-03 pending)
- [x] Run script on ACMA-WS014 (done 2026-02-20 — see `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/acma-ws014.md`)
- [ ] Run script on ACMA-WS003
- [ ] Run script on Lenovo laptop
- [ ] Catalog external drives (working vs non-working, capacity, interface)
- [ ] Document spare SSD and GPU specs
- [ ] Assess 7 monitors (model, size, resolution, inputs, condition)
- [ ] Assess 2x 4 TB spinning drives (SMART health, interface, age)
- [ ] Assess printers: HP and Epson (model, condition, ink/toner status, connectivity)
- [ ] Assess main router (model, firmware, ports, WiFi standard, throughput)
- [ ] Assess small router (model, firmware, capabilities)
- [ ] Consolidate results into a single inventory document

### Phase 3: Consolidation Plan
- [ ] Assess each device for repurpose potential (homelab server, NAS, GPU node, dev workstation, media PC, retire)
- [x] Plan GPU installation: which old PCs get the NVIDIA T400 cards
  - **Decision (2026-02-20)**: All 3 AceEngineer machines are identical (ASUS Z10PE-D16, same build). AceEngineer-01 confirmed has a free PCIe slot. Install one T400 in AceEngineer-02 and one in AceEngineer-03. AceEngineer-01 retains its GTX 750 Ti (T400 swap optional).
- [ ] Plan SSD installation: which device benefits most from the 500 GB SSD
- [ ] Lenovo laptop decision: use as headless server, external-monitor workstation, or retire
- [ ] External drive triage: data recovery for non-working drives, consolidation for working ones
- [ ] Cost/benefit of any additional upgrades (RAM, network cards, etc.)
- [ ] Network assessment: do current routers meet needs (coverage, WiFi 6/6E, throughput, VLANs, mesh)?
- [ ] New router recommendation if upgrade needed (model, features, cost justification)
- [ ] Small router repurpose decision: AP mode, mesh node, IoT network, or retire
- [ ] Final disposition plan per device

### Phase 4: Dev Environment Readiness
- [ ] **a/ Agent CLI health check**: On terminal startup, verify claude, codex, gemini CLIs are installed, on PATH, and running current versions
- [ ] **b/ Terminal configuration**: Terminal program always available on Linux (bash/zsh) and Windows (PowerShell/Windows Terminal); default start directory = workspace-hub; no time wasted navigating
- [ ] **c/ Machine-to-repo mapping**: Define per-machine manifest declaring which repos and submodules are worked on from that machine; clone/pull on startup if missing
- [ ] **d/ Domain tool maintenance**: Per-machine checks for assigned tools (e.g. blender, openfoam, gmsh, freecad, orcaflex); detect outdated versions; generate upgrade plan for user approval
- [ ] **e/ Automation via shell hooks**: Implement checks as shell profile hooks (.bashrc / PowerShell $PROFILE) calling a lightweight startup script; keep startup <2s; log verbose output to file for troubleshooting
- [ ] **f/ Machine alias names**: Each machine gets a public alias based on its assigned repos/role (e.g. "eng-workstation", "sim-node"); used in manifests, git configs, and commit metadata instead of raw hostnames

## Plan

### Current State Summary

**Completed (Phase 1):**
- Assessment scripts exist and work: `scripts/operations/system/hardware-assess.sh` (Linux) and `hardware-assess.ps1` (Windows)
- Skill documented: `.claude/skills/operations/devops/hardware-assessment/SKILL.md`
- AceEngineer-01 fully assessed: `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-01.md` (2026-02-02)
- Maintenance records: `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/maintenance/` has pre/post JSON assessments and system changelog for vamsee-linux1

**Remaining Phase 2 items:** AceEngineer-03, ACMA-WS003, Lenovo laptop, external drives, routers (AE-02, ACMA-WS014, gali-linux-compute-1 now done)

### Phase 2: Complete Inventory (2-3 sessions, requires physical access)

#### Step 2a: Windows Machine Assessments

1. Run `hardware-assess.ps1` on AceEngineer-02 (Windows 10):
   - Copy script via USB or network share
   - Execute: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File hardware-assess.ps1`
   - Save output to `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-02.md`
   - Note: This machine's OS is flagged "Illegal" -- record license status for Phase 3 decision
2. Run `hardware-assess.ps1` on AceEngineer-03 (Windows 10):
   - Same procedure, save to `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-03.md`
   - Record installed software versions (OrcaFlex, SolidWorks, COMSOL, MATLAB, etc.)
3. Run `hardware-assess.ps1` on ACMA-WS014 (Win11, i9) and ACMA-WS003 (Win10, i7):
   - Save to `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/acma-ws014.md` and `acma-ws003.md`
   - Note: these are work machines -- document any corporate policies on repurposing

#### Step 2b: Laptop Assessment

1. Connect Lenovo laptop to external monitor
2. Run appropriate assessment script (check OS first)
3. Save to `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/lenovo-laptop.md`
4. Document screen damage severity and external-monitor-only usability

#### Step 2c: Peripheral Inventory

1. External drives: Physically connect each, run `lsblk` or Disk Management, check SMART if available
2. Document in `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/storage-peripherals.md`:
   - Each drive: capacity, interface (USB2/3, SATA), working/non-working, data contents summary
   - Spare 500GB SSD: model, interface, health
3. Routers: Check admin panels (typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)
4. Document in `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/network-equipment.md`:
   - Main router: model, firmware version, WiFi standard, port count, current throughput
   - Small router: model, capabilities, current use
5. NVIDIA T400 GPUs: Record from box/label, document in storage-peripherals.md

#### Step 2d: Consolidation Document

1. Create `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/INVENTORY.md` -- single summary table of all devices
2. Include columns: Device, Hostname, CPU, RAM, GPU, Storage, OS, Status, Assessment Date
3. Link to individual assessment files

### Phase 3: Consolidation Decisions (1-2 sessions, after Phase 2 complete)

#### Step 3a: Repurpose Assessment Matrix

Create `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/consolidation-plan.md` with a decision matrix:

| Device | Current State | Repurpose Options | Recommended Role | Required Upgrades | Est. Cost |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|

Evaluate each device against these roles:
- **Homelab server** (Docker, self-hosted services): needs reliable storage, moderate CPU
- **NAS/backup server**: needs large storage, low CPU acceptable
- **GPU compute node**: needs PCIe slot for T400, adequate PSU
- **Dev workstation**: needs fast SSD, decent RAM
- **Media server** (Plex/Jellyfin): needs transcoding capability
- **Headless server**: suitable for broken-screen laptop
- **Retire/recycle**: if not cost-effective to repurpose

#### Step 3b: GPU and SSD Allocation

1. Determine which machines have available PCIe slots and adequate PSU for T400 cards
2. Determine which machine benefits most from the spare 500GB SSD (likely AceEngineer-02 or 03)
3. Document installation plan with required tools/adapters

#### Step 3c: Network Assessment

1. Evaluate current WiFi coverage, speed tests at various locations
2. Compare current router specs against needs (WiFi 6/6E, VLAN support, mesh capability)
3. If upgrade needed: recommend specific model with cost justification
4. Small router decision: AP mode, mesh node, IoT VLAN, or retire

#### Step 3d: External Drive Triage

1. Working drives: consolidate data to main storage, decide if drives are worth keeping
2. Non-working drives: attempt data recovery if valuable data suspected, then recycle
3. Document data disposition in consolidation plan

#### Step 3e: Final Disposition

1. Write final recommendation per device in consolidation-plan.md
2. Include cost estimates for any upgrades (RAM, storage, OS licenses)
3. Prioritize actions by cost-effectiveness and immediate utility
4. AceEngineer-02 OS decision: Ubuntu install planned per existing notes -- confirm and schedule

### Phase 4: Dev Environment Readiness (after Phase 3 assigns machine roles)

#### Step 4a: Machine Manifest Files

1. Create `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/manifests/<hostname>.yml` per machine
2. Each manifest declares:
   - `hostname`, `os`, `role` (from Phase 3 consolidation plan)
   - `alias`: public-facing name based on assigned work (e.g. `eng-workstation`, `sim-node`, `data-server`); used in git configs, commit metadata, and logs instead of raw hostnames
   - `repos`: list of repos/submodules this machine works on (e.g. `[worldenergydata, digitalmodel]`)
   - `agent_clis`: required agent CLIs with minimum versions (`claude >= 1.x`, `codex >= 0.x`, `gemini >= 0.x`)
   - `domain_tools`: required tools with minimum versions (`blender >= 4.x`, `openfoam >= 12`, `gmsh >= 4.x`, `freecad >= 1.x`, etc.)
   - `workspace_root`: path to workspace-hub on that machine
3. Manifests are committed to repo — single source of truth for what each machine needs

**Standing assignment policy:**
- **vamsee-linux1 (AceEngineer-01)**: worldenergydata analysis and data curation, digitalmodel Python development, assetutilities, workspace-hub orchestration. All open-source / AI-agent work defaults here.
- **Licensed-software machines** (AceEngineer-03, ACMA workstations): tasks requiring proprietary licenses (OrcaFlex, SolidWorks, COMSOL, MATLAB, Autodesk Inventor, 3ds Max, Moses). Route work to these only when the license is needed.

#### Step 4b: Dev Environment Check Script

1. Create `scripts/operations/system/dev-env-check.sh` (Linux) and `dev-env-check.ps1` (Windows)
2. Script reads the manifest for current hostname and validates:
   - **Agent CLIs** (a/): checks `claude --version`, `codex --version`, `gemini --version`; compares against manifest minimums; reports outdated/missing
   - **Terminal config** (b/): verifies cwd is workspace-hub; warns if not
   - **Repos** (c/): checks each declared repo exists at expected path; reports missing repos with clone instructions
   - **Domain tools** (d/): checks each declared tool version; if outdated, generates an upgrade plan (commands to run) and writes to `~/.dev-env-upgrade-plan.md` for user review
3. Output: color-coded summary (green = OK, yellow = outdated, red = missing)
4. Verbose log to `~/.dev-env-check.log` for troubleshooting
5. Exit 0 always (informational, never blocks terminal startup)
6. Target: <2 seconds execution time

#### Step 4c: Shell Profile Integration

1. **Linux**: Add one-liner to `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   [ -f /path/to/workspace-hub/scripts/operations/system/dev-env-check.sh ] && source /path/to/workspace-hub/scripts/operations/system/dev-env-check.sh
   ```
2. **Windows**: Add to PowerShell `$PROFILE`:
   ```powershell
   if (Test-Path "C:\path\to\workspace-hub\scripts\operations\system\dev-env-check.ps1") { & "C:\path\to\workspace-hub\scripts\operations\system\dev-env-check.ps1" }
   ```
3. Set default start directory to workspace-hub in terminal emulator settings (Windows Terminal `settings.json`, Linux `.bashrc` `cd`)
4. Document setup instructions per OS in `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/dev-env-setup.md`

#### Step 4d: Claude Code Pre-Session Hook (optional enhancement)

1. Consider adding to `.claude/settings.json` hooks to run `dev-env-check` before first tool use
2. Trade-off: shell profile catches all terminals; Claude hook only fires in Claude sessions
3. Recommendation: shell profile as primary, Claude hook as belt-and-suspenders for agent-specific checks

### Review Notes

**Cross-review date**: 2026-02-10

| Reviewer | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Claude Opus 4.6 | APPROVE |
| Gemini CLI | APPROVE |
| Codex CLI | NO_OUTPUT |

**Feedback incorporated**:
- All software artifacts verified (assessment scripts, skill file, AE-01 assessment)
- Remaining work is physical access to hardware (6 devices unassessed)

*Approved by user: 2026-02-10*

**RAM market intel (2026-02-21):** Prices are in a crisis driven by AI server demand — DDR4 32GB kits up ~2x (was $60–90, now $150–180); DDR5 32GB up ~3x (was $80–120, now $360–410). Analysts expect a further 55–60% rise in Q1 2026 with no relief before late 2026 or 2027. Implication for Phase 3 cost/benefit: **hold off on RAM upgrades unless strictly necessary** — the DDR3 spare sticks remain incompatible with AceEngineer-01/02/03 (those need DDR4 ECC). If AceEngineer-02/03 assessment reveals less than 16 GB, a targeted DDR4 ECC buy may still be justified given those machines' workloads, but buy before prices rise further. (Source: Tom's Hardware RAM Price Index 2026, TechRadar, WCCFTech)

**Work assignments (2026-02-11):** Added machine-to-repo assignment policy:
- AceEngineer-01 (vamsee-linux1) is the primary machine for worldenergydata analysis and data curation
- Exception: tasks requiring proprietary software licenses (e.g. OrcaFlex, SolidWorks, MATLAB, COMSOL) go to machines with those licenses (AceEngineer-03, ACMA workstations)
- This decision feeds into Phase 4 manifests (`repos` field for vamsee-linux1)

**Scope expansion (2026-02-10):** Added Phase 4 — Dev Environment Readiness (items a-e):
- a/ Agent CLI health checks on terminal startup
- b/ Terminal always configured, starts in workspace-hub
- c/ Per-machine repo/submodule work assignments via manifests
- d/ Domain tool version checks with upgrade plans
- e/ Shell profile hooks as automation mechanism
- f/ Machine alias names for public repos (based on assigned work)
- Phase 4 plan pending cross-review

**Inventory update (2026-02-10):** Added full hardware counts — 7 monitors, 2x 4TB spinning drives, 2 printers (HP + Epson). Summary: 1 Mac, 2 Windows, 2 Linux, 1 Lenovo laptop (broken screen); 7 monitors; 2x 4TB HDD; 2 printers.

*Source: hardware consolidation work — 1 Mac, 2 Windows, 2 Linux computers, 1 Lenovo laptop broken screen, 7 monitors, 2x NVIDIA T400 4GB spare, 2x 4TB used spinning hard drives, old external drives working/non-working, 1x 500GB internal SSD, 2 printers (HP + Epson), 1 main router, 1 small router, cross-platform assessment script + dev environment readiness*

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Hardware consolidation and dev environment readiness directly enables more capable agentic sessions — machines that can't run agents reliably are a bottleneck.
- Hardware assessment automation is stable utility work; improved AI won't change the physical inventory situation.
- **Disposition: do now** — machine readiness is a prerequisite for agentic workflows; every session that runs on an unconfigured machine loses productivity; close this soon.
