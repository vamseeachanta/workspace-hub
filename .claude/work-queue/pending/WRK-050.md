# Hardware Consolidation

## What
Inventory, assess, and consolidate all available hardware into a coherent plan for repurposing, upgrading, or retiring each device. Build a cross-platform hardware assessment script (Windows + Linux) to automate data collection.

## Why
Multiple devices are sitting idle or underutilized. A systematic inventory and assessment identifies what can be repurposed (homelab, NAS, dev workstation, GPU compute) vs. what should be retired or recycled.

## Hardware Inventory

### AceEngineer Computers (3x)

*Mapped from `aceengineer-admin/admin/hardware.md` — AceEngineer-01/02/03*

**AceEngineer-01 (vamsee-linux1)** — current primary workstation, specs confirmed via system query:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| CPU | 2x Intel Xeon E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40 GHz (8 cores / 16 threads each, 16C/32T total) |
| RAM | 32 GB |
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti, 2 GB VRAM (driver 535.288.01) |
| Storage | 250 GB SSD (CT250BX100SSD1), 1 TB HDD (WDC WD10EZEX), 8 TB HDD (ST8000DM004) |
| Network | 4x Ethernet (enp3s0f0/f1, enp4s0f0/f1), Tailscale VPN |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (Noble Numbat), kernel 6.8.0-90-generic |

**AceEngineer-02:**

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| RAM | 32 GB |
| OS | Windows 10 (noted as "Illegal" — consider replacing with Ubuntu) |
| Software | — |
| Notes | hardware.md suggests: Change to Ubuntu, install FreeCAD + OpenFOAM |
| Remaining | CPU, GPU, storage — TBD, run assessment script |

**AceEngineer-03:**

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| RAM | 32 GB |
| OS | Windows 10 (not registered) |
| Software | OrcaFlex 10.0, SolidWorks Pro 2015, Autodesk Inventor 2015, 3ds Max, COMSOL Multiphysics, Moses Enterprise V8i, MATLAB |
| Remaining | CPU, GPU, storage — TBD, run assessment script |

### ACMA Work Computers (2x)
| Asset Tag | CPU | RAM | GPU | OS |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| ACMA-WS014 | i9 2 GHz | 16 GB | 8 GB graphics card | Windows 11 |
| ACMA-WS003 | i7 3 GHz | 16 GB | — | Windows 10 |

*Source: `acma-projects/admin/it/hardware.md`*

### Spare GPUs
- 2x NVIDIA T400, 4 GB — can be installed in old PCs for GPU compute or display output

### Laptop
- 1x Lenovo laptop — broken screen, functional with external monitor only

### Storage
- Old external hard drives (mix of working and non-working) — need assessment
- 1x 500 GB internal SSD drive (spare)

### Networking Equipment
- 1x Main router — model/specs TBD, run assessment
- 1x Small router — model/specs TBD, run assessment
- Evaluate whether a new router purchase is needed (coverage, speed, features)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Assessment Script
- [x] Cross-platform script (handles Windows via PowerShell + Linux via Bash)
- [x] Collects: CPU model/cores/speed, RAM size/type, GPU model/VRAM, storage devices/capacity/health, motherboard model, network interfaces, OS version
- [x] Output: structured JSON or YAML for easy comparison
- [x] External drive health check (SMART data where available)
- [x] Portable — runs without installing additional software (or minimal deps)

### Phase 2: Inventory
- [~] Run script on all 3 old PCs (AceEngineer-01 done, 02/03 pending)
- [ ] Run script on 2 ACMA work computers
- [ ] Run script on Lenovo laptop
- [ ] Catalog external drives (working vs non-working, capacity, interface)
- [ ] Document spare SSD and GPU specs
- [ ] Assess main router (model, firmware, ports, WiFi standard, throughput)
- [ ] Assess small router (model, firmware, capabilities)
- [ ] Consolidate results into a single inventory document

### Phase 3: Consolidation Plan
- [ ] Assess each device for repurpose potential (homelab server, NAS, GPU node, dev workstation, media PC, retire)
- [ ] Plan GPU installation: which old PCs get the NVIDIA T400 cards
- [ ] Plan SSD installation: which device benefits most from the 500 GB SSD
- [ ] Lenovo laptop decision: use as headless server, external-monitor workstation, or retire
- [ ] External drive triage: data recovery for non-working drives, consolidation for working ones
- [ ] Cost/benefit of any additional upgrades (RAM, network cards, etc.)
- [ ] Network assessment: do current routers meet needs (coverage, WiFi 6/6E, throughput, VLANs, mesh)?
- [ ] New router recommendation if upgrade needed (model, features, cost justification)
- [ ] Small router repurpose decision: AP mode, mesh node, IoT network, or retire
- [ ] Final disposition plan per device
