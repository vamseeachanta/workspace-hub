# Hardware Consolidation

## What
Inventory, assess, and consolidate all available hardware into a coherent plan for repurposing, upgrading, or retiring each device. Build a cross-platform hardware assessment script (Windows + Linux) to automate data collection.

## Why
Multiple devices are sitting idle or underutilized. A systematic inventory and assessment identifies what can be repurposed (homelab, NAS, dev workstation, GPU compute) vs. what should be retired or recycled.

## Hardware Inventory

### Old Personal Computers (3x) — configs to be provided
| # | Description | Configuration |
|---|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Old PC #1 | TBD — run assessment script |
| 2 | Old PC #2 | TBD — run assessment script |
| 3 | Old PC #3 | TBD — run assessment script |

### ACMA Work Computers (2x)
| Asset Tag | CPU | RAM | GPU | OS |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| ACMA-WS014 | i9 2 GHz | 16 GB | 8 GB graphics card | Windows 11 |
| ACMA-WS003 | i7 3 GHz | 16 GB | — | Windows 10 |

### Spare GPUs
- 2x NVIDIA T400, 4 GB — can be installed in old PCs for GPU compute or display output

### Laptop
- 1x Lenovo laptop — broken screen, functional with external monitor only

### Storage
- Old external hard drives (mix of working and non-working) — need assessment
- 1x 500 GB internal SSD drive (spare)

### Networking Equipment
- 1x Main router — model/specs TBD, run assessment
- 1x Small router — model/specs TBD, run assessment
- Evaluate whether a new router purchase is needed (coverage, speed, features)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Assessment Script
- [ ] Cross-platform script (handles Windows via PowerShell + Linux via Bash)
- [ ] Collects: CPU model/cores/speed, RAM size/type, GPU model/VRAM, storage devices/capacity/health, motherboard model, network interfaces, OS version
- [ ] Output: structured JSON or YAML for easy comparison
- [ ] External drive health check (SMART data where available)
- [ ] Portable — runs without installing additional software (or minimal deps)

### Phase 2: Inventory
- [ ] Run script on all 3 old PCs
- [ ] Run script on 2 ACMA work computers
- [ ] Run script on Lenovo laptop
- [ ] Catalog external drives (working vs non-working, capacity, interface)
- [ ] Document spare SSD and GPU specs
- [ ] Assess main router (model, firmware, ports, WiFi standard, throughput)
- [ ] Assess small router (model, firmware, capabilities)
- [ ] Consolidate results into a single inventory document

### Phase 3: Consolidation Plan
- [ ] Assess each device for repurpose potential (homelab server, NAS, GPU node, dev workstation, media PC, retire)
- [ ] Plan GPU installation: which old PCs get the NVIDIA T400 cards
- [ ] Plan SSD installation: which device benefits most from the 500 GB SSD
- [ ] Lenovo laptop decision: use as headless server, external-monitor workstation, or retire
- [ ] External drive triage: data recovery for non-working drives, consolidation for working ones
- [ ] Cost/benefit of any additional upgrades (RAM, network cards, etc.)
- [ ] Network assessment: do current routers meet needs (coverage, WiFi 6/6E, throughput, VLANs, mesh)?
- [ ] New router recommendation if upgrade needed (model, features, cost justification)
- [ ] Small router repurpose decision: AP mode, mesh node, IoT network, or retire
- [ ] Final disposition plan per device
