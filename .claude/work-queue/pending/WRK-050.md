# Hardware Consolidation

## What
Inventory, assess, and consolidate all available hardware into a coherent plan for repurposing, upgrading, or retiring each device. Build a cross-platform hardware assessment script (Windows + Linux) to automate data collection.

## Why
Multiple devices are sitting idle or underutilized. A systematic inventory and assessment identifies what can be repurposed (homelab, NAS, dev workstation, GPU compute) vs. what should be retired or recycled.

## Hardware Inventory

### AceEngineer Computers (3x)

*Mapped from `aceengineer-admin/admin/hardware.md` — AceEngineer-01/02/03*

**AceEngineer-01 (vamsee-linux1)** — current primary workstation, specs confirmed via system query:

*Source: `acma-projects/admin/it/hardware.md`*

### Spare GPUs
- 2x NVIDIA T400, 4 GB — can be installed in old PCs for GPU compute or display output

### Laptop
- 1x Lenovo laptop — broken screen, functional with external monitor only

### Storage
- Old external hard drives (mix of working and non-working) — need assessment
- 1x 500 GB internal SSD drive (spare)

### Networking Equipment
- 1x Main router — model/specs TBD, run assessment
- 1x Small router — model/specs TBD, run assessment
- Evaluate whether a new router purchase is needed (coverage, speed, features)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Assessment Script
- [x] Cross-platform script (handles Windows via PowerShell + Linux via Bash)
- [x] Collects: CPU model/cores/speed, RAM size/type, GPU model/VRAM, storage devices/capacity/health, motherboard model, network interfaces, OS version
- [x] Output: structured JSON or YAML for easy comparison
- [x] External drive health check (SMART data where available)
- [x] Portable — runs without installing additional software (or minimal deps)

### Phase 2: Inventory
- [~] Run script on all 3 old PCs (AceEngineer-01 done, 02/03 pending)
- [ ] Run script on 2 ACMA work computers
- [ ] Run script on Lenovo laptop
- [ ] Catalog external drives (working vs non-working, capacity, interface)
- [ ] Document spare SSD and GPU specs
- [ ] Assess main router (model, firmware, ports, WiFi standard, throughput)
- [ ] Assess small router (model, firmware, capabilities)
- [ ] Consolidate results into a single inventory document

### Phase 3: Consolidation Plan
- [ ] Assess each device for repurpose potential (homelab server, NAS, GPU node, dev workstation, media PC, retire)
- [ ] Plan GPU installation: which old PCs get the NVIDIA T400 cards
- [ ] Plan SSD installation: which device benefits most from the 500 GB SSD
- [ ] Lenovo laptop decision: use as headless server, external-monitor workstation, or retire
- [ ] External drive triage: data recovery for non-working drives, consolidation for working ones
- [ ] Cost/benefit of any additional upgrades (RAM, network cards, etc.)
- [ ] Network assessment: do current routers meet needs (coverage, WiFi 6/6E, throughput, VLANs, mesh)?
- [ ] New router recommendation if upgrade needed (model, features, cost justification)
- [ ] Small router repurpose decision: AP mode, mesh node, IoT network, or retire
- [ ] Final disposition plan per device

## Completed Assessments

| Device | Hostname | Assessment | Date |
|--------|----------|------------|------|
| AceEngineer-01 | vamsee-linux1 | [specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-01.md](../../specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-01.md) | 2026-02-02 |

## Assessment Script

Skill: `.claude/skills/operations/devops/hardware-assessment/SKILL.md`
Scripts: `scripts/operations/system/hardware-assess.sh` (Linux) | `scripts/operations/system/hardware-assess.ps1` (Windows)

## Plan

### Current State Summary

**Completed (Phase 1):**
- Assessment scripts exist and work: `scripts/operations/system/hardware-assess.sh` (Linux) and `hardware-assess.ps1` (Windows)
- Skill documented: `.claude/skills/operations/devops/hardware-assessment/SKILL.md`
- AceEngineer-01 fully assessed: `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-01.md` (2026-02-02)
- Maintenance records: `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/maintenance/` has pre/post JSON assessments and system changelog for vamsee-linux1

**Remaining Phase 2 items:** 6 devices unassessed (AceEngineer-02, AceEngineer-03, ACMA-WS014, ACMA-WS003, Lenovo laptop, plus external drives and routers)

### Phase 2: Complete Inventory (2-3 sessions, requires physical access)

#### Step 2a: Windows Machine Assessments

1. Run `hardware-assess.ps1` on AceEngineer-02 (Windows 10):
   - Copy script via USB or network share
   - Execute: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File hardware-assess.ps1`
   - Save output to `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-02.md`
   - Note: This machine's OS is flagged "Illegal" -- record license status for Phase 3 decision
2. Run `hardware-assess.ps1` on AceEngineer-03 (Windows 10):
   - Same procedure, save to `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-03.md`
   - Record installed software versions (OrcaFlex, SolidWorks, COMSOL, MATLAB, etc.)
3. Run `hardware-assess.ps1` on ACMA-WS014 (Win11, i9) and ACMA-WS003 (Win10, i7):
   - Save to `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/acma-ws014.md` and `acma-ws003.md`
   - Note: these are work machines -- document any corporate policies on repurposing

#### Step 2b: Laptop Assessment

1. Connect Lenovo laptop to external monitor
2. Run appropriate assessment script (check OS first)
3. Save to `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/lenovo-laptop.md`
4. Document screen damage severity and external-monitor-only usability

#### Step 2c: Peripheral Inventory

1. External drives: Physically connect each, run `lsblk` or Disk Management, check SMART if available
2. Document in `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/storage-peripherals.md`:
   - Each drive: capacity, interface (USB2/3, SATA), working/non-working, data contents summary
   - Spare 500GB SSD: model, interface, health
3. Routers: Check admin panels (typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)
4. Document in `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/network-equipment.md`:
   - Main router: model, firmware version, WiFi standard, port count, current throughput
   - Small router: model, capabilities, current use
5. NVIDIA T400 GPUs: Record from box/label, document in storage-peripherals.md

#### Step 2d: Consolidation Document

1. Create `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/INVENTORY.md` -- single summary table of all devices
2. Include columns: Device, Hostname, CPU, RAM, GPU, Storage, OS, Status, Assessment Date
3. Link to individual assessment files

### Phase 3: Consolidation Decisions (1-2 sessions, after Phase 2 complete)

#### Step 3a: Repurpose Assessment Matrix

Create `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/consolidation-plan.md` with a decision matrix:

| Device | Current State | Repurpose Options | Recommended Role | Required Upgrades | Est. Cost |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|

Evaluate each device against these roles:
- **Homelab server** (Docker, self-hosted services): needs reliable storage, moderate CPU
- **NAS/backup server**: needs large storage, low CPU acceptable
- **GPU compute node**: needs PCIe slot for T400, adequate PSU
- **Dev workstation**: needs fast SSD, decent RAM
- **Media server** (Plex/Jellyfin): needs transcoding capability
- **Headless server**: suitable for broken-screen laptop
- **Retire/recycle**: if not cost-effective to repurpose

#### Step 3b: GPU and SSD Allocation

1. Determine which machines have available PCIe slots and adequate PSU for T400 cards
2. Determine which machine benefits most from the spare 500GB SSD (likely AceEngineer-02 or 03)
3. Document installation plan with required tools/adapters

#### Step 3c: Network Assessment

1. Evaluate current WiFi coverage, speed tests at various locations
2. Compare current router specs against needs (WiFi 6/6E, VLAN support, mesh capability)
3. If upgrade needed: recommend specific model with cost justification
4. Small router decision: AP mode, mesh node, IoT VLAN, or retire

#### Step 3d: External Drive Triage

1. Working drives: consolidate data to main storage, decide if drives are worth keeping
2. Non-working drives: attempt data recovery if valuable data suspected, then recycle
3. Document data disposition in consolidation plan

#### Step 3e: Final Disposition

1. Write final recommendation per device in consolidation-plan.md
2. Include cost estimates for any upgrades (RAM, storage, OS licenses)
3. Prioritize actions by cost-effectiveness and immediate utility
4. AceEngineer-02 OS decision: Ubuntu install planned per existing notes -- confirm and schedule
