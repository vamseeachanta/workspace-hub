## Context

The `/today` skill and `daily_today.sh` were refactored 2026-02-25 into a modular section-based
architecture (`scripts/productivity/sections/`). Each section is an independent script called
by the orchestrator. The system should improve over time.

## Current State (2026-02-25)

Sections implemented:
- `ai-usage-summary.sh` — tool versions table + models in use
- `wrk-health.sh` — pipeline / priority / complexity / machine load
- `git-summary.sh` — git commits across repos
- `branch-status.sh` — branch state
- `suggestions.sh` — pattern-based suggestions

## Enhancements Needed

### P1 — Session Rollup (this session's work → report)
- [ ] Add `session-rollup.sh` section: summarises actions taken in the current session
  (new files, WRK items created/closed, scripts added, cron changes)
- [ ] Write session events to `logs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.yaml` at key moments
- [ ] `/today` morning review reads yesterday's session logs for rollup

### P2 — Timeline Analysis
- [ ] `timeline.sh` section: shows WRK items opened/closed per day (last 7 days)
- [ ] Reads `logs/daily/*.md` frontmatter + git log to build a compact timeline table
- [ ] Surfaces velocity trends (items/day, commits/day)

### P3 — Trend Improvement
- [ ] `wrk-health.sh` should track delta vs yesterday (items completed since last run)
- [ ] `ai-usage-summary.sh` should track version change events (upgrades)
- [ ] Weekly rollup: auto-generate `logs/weekly/` from 7 daily logs

### P4 — Skill Integration
- [ ] Publish as `/daily-report` skill so it can be invoked from any session
- [ ] Skill reads pre-built log; does not re-run scripts (fast)

## Acceptance

- `daily_today.sh` output includes session rollup + timeline sections
- `logs/sessions/` captures key session events automatically
- Weekly reports auto-populate from daily logs
- All new sections follow the modular pattern (standalone, tested independently)
