# CP Marketing Brochure — Cathodic Protection Capability Document

## What

Create a marketing brochure for A&CE's cathodic protection engineering capability.
Blocked by WRK-271 (worked examples) — the brochure references real calculation
outputs and demonstrated capabilities, not generic claims.

## Why

CP is A&CE's core corrosion prevention capability. No brochure exists. The FFS brochure
(WRK-206 done) covers damage assessment (what happens when corrosion occurs); CP covers
prevention (stopping it). Together they tell the complete corrosion management story
for a client.

## Output

`digitalmodel/docs/marketing/cathodic-protection-brochure.md`

### Content structure

1. **Capability statement** — what A&CE delivers in CP engineering
2. **Standards coverage** — DNV-RP-B401, DNV-RP-F103, ABS GN Ships/Offshore (versions confirmed per WRK-269)
3. **Structure types** — pipelines, ship hulls, offshore jackets, subsea equipment (scope per WRK-271/272 completions)
4. **What we calculate** — anode mass, count, spacing, current demand, design life, coating breakdown
5. **Worked example reference** — link to Example 1/2/3 from WRK-271 with summary result table
6. **Integration with FFS** — CP (prevention) + FFS (damage assessment) = complete integrity lifecycle
7. **Typical deliverables** — CP design report, anode schedule, inspection and monitoring plan

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Brochure created at `digitalmodel/docs/marketing/cathodic-protection-brochure.md`
- [ ] References at least 2 worked examples from WRK-271
- [ ] Standards table accurate per WRK-269 inventory
- [ ] `see_also:` links to FFS brochure (once created)
- [ ] Reviewed for legal compliance (no client identifiers)
- [ ] `brochure_status` on WRK-271 and WRK-272 items set to `pending` (triggers aceengineer-website sync)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Brochure content is stable; no reason to defer once examples exist
- Gemini is strong for polished prose generation from structured inputs
- **Disposition: park until WRK-271 done, then Route A**
