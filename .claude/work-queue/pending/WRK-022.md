# US property valuation analysis using GIS and spatial factors

## What
Build a property valuation analysis tool for US properties that incorporates geographic location, road vehicle count (traffic volume), and other spatial factors to assess property value. Utilize GIS skills and tools (Google Maps, QGIS, public GIS data) to gather and analyze location-based attributes that influence property value.

Factors to consider:
- **Geographic location**: neighborhood, proximity to amenities, school districts, zoning
- **Traffic/vehicle counts**: road traffic volume from DOT data, highway proximity
- **Spatial factors**: flood zones, elevation, proximity to commercial centers, transit access
- **Market data**: comparable sales, tax assessments, listing prices

## Why
Property value is heavily influenced by location-specific factors that are best analyzed spatially. Combining traditional valuation inputs with GIS-derived spatial intelligence provides a more comprehensive and defensible property assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Property lookup by address with geocoding
- [ ] GIS-based spatial attribute extraction for a given property:
  - Road vehicle count / traffic volume (DOT/state traffic count data)
  - Flood zone status (FEMA data)
  - School district and ratings
  - Proximity to amenities (commercial, transit, parks)
  - Zoning classification
- [ ] Integration with property market data (Zillow API, tax records, comparable sales)
- [ ] Valuation model incorporating spatial and market factors
- [ ] Visualization: property on map with overlaid spatial factors
- [ ] Comparable property analysis within configurable radius
- [ ] Report output with valuation estimate and supporting spatial analysis
- [ ] Document data sources, methodology, and limitations
