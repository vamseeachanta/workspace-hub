# Pipeline wall thickness calculations with parametric utilisation analysis

## What
Develop pipeline wall thickness calculation tools to perform parametric analysis across varying load conditions (bending, tension, pressure, combined) and produce pipe utilisation ratios for different wall thicknesses, diameters, and material grades.

## Why
Pipeline wall thickness selection is a fundamental design task. Parametric utilisation analysis across load combinations enables rapid design iteration, identification of governing load cases, and optimised wall thickness selection for cost-effective pipeline design.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wall thickness calculations per relevant design code (e.g. DNV-ST-F101, API 1111)
- [ ] Parametric input: varying wall thickness, OD, material grade, SMYS
- [ ] Load parametrics: varying bending moments, tensions, internal/external pressure
- [ ] Combined loading utilisation checks (pressure, bending, tension interactions)
- [ ] Utilisation ratio output for each load combination and wall thickness
- [ ] Summary tables and/or graphs showing utilisation vs. load parameters
- [ ] Identification of governing load case per wall thickness
- [ ] Tests validating calculations against known reference results
- [ ] Documentation of design code references and assumptions
