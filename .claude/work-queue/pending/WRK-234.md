# MISSION: Self-improving agent ecosystem — sessions drive skills, skills drive better sessions

## Mission Statement

**Build an ecosystem where every session automatically makes the next session better.** Sessions are analysed at the end. Analysis routes signals to the right destinations — skills curation, work queue, agentic uplift pipeline, preflight hooks. Skills improve. Context noise is removed. Gaps surface as work items. The agent gets more autonomous over time, not more dependent on manual nudging.

This is the single objective that all child items serve. Every decision in the child items should be tested against it: *does this make sessions self-improving?*

## Why This Parent Exists

The child items (WRK-225 through WRK-233) were planned individually and are well-specified. But without a parent that holds the single mission, agentic execution risks:
- **Contradictions** — two items solving the same problem differently
- **Drift** — an item optimises locally but undermines the overall loop
- **Gaps** — an integration point between two items is nobody's responsibility
- **Misaligned priorities** — effort goes to interesting work rather than critical-path work

This item is the coordination point. When executing child items agentically, each agent reads this mission first and validates its output against it before committing.

## Child Items — Execution Order

| Order | WRK | Title | Why this position |
|-------|-----|-------|
-------------------|
| 1 | WRK-228 | Agentic horizon template + backfill | Sets thinking model for all subsequent items |
| 2 | WRK-231 | session-analysis skill | The engine — everything else feeds from or into it |
| 3 | WRK-232 | session-bootstrap per machine | Seeds the engine with 241 existing sessions |
| 4 | WRK-226 | Agent performance audit + preflight | Consumes session noise signal; already working |
| 5 | WRK-229 | Skills curation pipeline | Consumes shallow gap + skill score signals |
| 6 | WRK-230 | Session lifecycle unification | Unifies stop hooks; depends on 231 being in place |
| 7 | WRK-233 | Workflow simplification | Assesses everything against the linear flow |
| — | WRK-225 | Plugins vs skills | Independent research; informs skills strategy |
| — | WRK-227 | Cowork evaluation | Blocked by 225; independent of main loop |

## Alignment Rules for Agentic Execution

When executing any child item, the executing agent must:

1. **Read this mission first** — understand the single objective before touching any file
2. **Test each decision against the loop** — does this output slot into the linear flow? Where exactly?
3. **Check for contradictions** — does this duplicate or conflict with an adjacent item? If yes, stop and surface to user
4. **Prefer integration over invention** — extend existing hooks/skills before creating new ones
5. **Linear output, graph internals** — user-visible output (docs, reports, summaries) must be linear; complexity goes into state files and graphs
6. **One file at a time** — changes are atomic; each file edit is independently reviewable
7. **Surface, don't decide** — when uncertain between two approaches, surface both to user; do not pick autonomously for mission-level decisions

## Success Metrics

The mission is succeeding when these trends move in the right direction across sessions:

| Metric | Direction | Measure |
|--------|-----------|
---------|
| User intervention rate | ↓ decreasing | Corrections + redirects per session |
| Skill one-shot rate | ↑ increasing | % of skill invocations that required no correction |
| WRK items completed per session | ↑ increasing | Queue throughput |
| New skills created per month | ↑ then plateau | Ecosystem growth then stability |
| Session analysis actionable output rate | ↑ increasing | % of sessions producing ≥1 gap/skill/script signal |
| Anti-pattern recurrence | ↓ decreasing | Same anti-patterns not repeating |

## Agentic AI Horizon

This mission *is* the agentic AI investment. Every child item either:
- Builds infrastructure that agents will use autonomously (session-analysis, curation pipeline, preflight hooks)
- Improves agent quality directly (skill scores, noise reduction, workflow clarity)
- Positions the ecosystem for the next generation of agentic capability (linear workflows, tool graph, script uplift)

**Nothing here is "get it done today" work. All of it compounds.**

## Child Item Status

*Last assessed: 2026-02-24 by WRK-234 coordination agent*

| WRK | Title | Status | Notes |
|-----|-------|--------|-------|
| WRK-225 | Plugins vs skills trade-off | archived/parked | Disposition: park until May 2026 — Claude Code plugin ecosystem too immature; revisit then |
| WRK-226 | Agent performance audit + preflight | pending | Being handled by separate agent (a55eaf94042e51c6c) — do not duplicate |
| WRK-227 | Cowork relevance evaluation | parked | `parked_until: 2026-04-01` — agentic coding landscape too fast-moving; skip until April |
| WRK-228 | Cross-machine terminal UX consistency | pending | Requires analysis-first audit across multiple machines (ACMA-ANSYS05 + Linux nodes); cannot execute on ace-linux-1 alone — blocked on multi-machine access |
| WRK-229 | AI agent QA closure loop | pending | Architectural item; depends on WRK-228 HTML template standard; not yet actionable without that foundation |
| WRK-230 | Session handoff: commit pending changes + submodule sync | pending | WRK-230 describes changes from session 127 (2026-02-21/22); those changes appear to have been committed in subsequent sessions (orcawave-lessons.md and WRK-129 spec are committed); item may be stale — user should verify and close if complete |
| WRK-231 | session-analysis skill | **done** | Archived at `.claude/work-queue/archive/2026-02/WRK-231.md`; `status: done`, `percent_complete: 100` |
| WRK-232 | session-bootstrap skill | **done** | Archived at `.claude/work-queue/archive/2026-02/WRK-232.md`; `status: done`, `percent_complete: 100` |
| WRK-233 | Workflow simplification | **done** | Archived at `.claude/work-queue/archive/2026-02/WRK-233.md`; `status: done`, `percent_complete: 100` |

### Summary

- **Done (3/9):** WRK-231, WRK-232, WRK-233
- **Parked/deferred (2/9):** WRK-225 (park until May 2026), WRK-227 (park until April 2026)
- **Delegated to other agent (1/9):** WRK-226
- **Pending — blocked/needs multi-machine (1/9):** WRK-228 (analysis-first, needs access to all machines)
- **Pending — depends on WRK-228 (1/9):** WRK-229
- **Pending — likely stale, needs user verification (1/9):** WRK-230

### Percent Complete Calculation

3 done out of 9 children = 33%. WRK-225 and WRK-227 are parked rather than complete.
WRK-226 is in active progress by another agent (not counted as complete yet).
WRK-228/229 are structurally blocked on multi-machine access.
WRK-230 needs user verification before closing.

### Next Actions for This Mission

1. **WRK-230**: User to verify if session 127 changes (orcawave-lessons.md, submodule sync) were committed; if yes, close WRK-230 as done — this would bring completion to 4/9 (44%)
2. **WRK-228**: When user has terminal access to Windows machine (ACMA-ANSYS05), execute Phase 1 analysis audit; WRK-229 unlocks after WRK-228 HTML template is defined
3. **WRK-226**: Monitor progress from delegated agent; will update tracker when complete
4. **WRK-225**: Revisit May 2026 — Claude Code plugin ecosystem maturity check
5. **WRK-227**: Revisit April 2026
