# DNV-ST-F101 pressure containment checks for subsea pipelines

## What

Implement DNV-ST-F101 Section 5 pressure containment checks: design pressure, incidental
pressure, system pressure test, MAOP validation, burst limit state. ASCII-first config input.
Wire into doris pipeline design workflow.

## Why

DNV-ST-F101 is the primary international standard for submarine pipeline design. Pressure
containment is the first design check performed in any pipeline project. Having this
implemented in doris enables rapid wall thickness verification and design compliance checks
for subsea pipeline projects.

## Standards

- DNV-ST-F101

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Burst limit state check per DNV-ST-F101 Section 5.4.2
- [x] Collapse limit state check per DNV-ST-F101 Section 5.4.4
- [x] Combined loading check (pressure + bending) per Section 5.4.5
- [x] System pressure test calculation per Section 5.4.2.3
- [x] MAOP validation
- [x] Safety class factors (Low, Normal, High) configurable
- [x] ASCII-first config input: pipe geometry, material, operating conditions
- [x] Pytest coverage with DNV-ST-F101 published example calculations
