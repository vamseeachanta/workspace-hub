# Parametric hull form analysis with RAO generation and client-facing lookup graphs

## What
Run parametric analysis across many hull forms to establish RAOs (Response Amplitude Operators), then generate lookup graphs suitable for displaying to clients. The system should support batch execution across hull form variations and produce polished, presentation-ready output.

## Why
Clients need quick visual reference for vessel motion characteristics across different hull forms. A parametric approach with pre-computed RAOs and lookup graphs enables rapid comparison, informed decision-making, and professional client deliverables without re-running analyses each time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Parametric hull form definitions (varying key parameters: beam, draft, length, displacement, etc.)
- [ ] Batch analysis pipeline to run diffraction analysis across hull form variations
- [ ] RAO extraction for key responses (heave, pitch, roll, surge, sway, yaw)
- [ ] RAO database/storage indexed by hull form parameters
- [ ] Lookup graph generation — RAO plots per hull form and comparison across forms
- [ ] Client-facing graph formatting (professional styling, clear labels, legends)
- [ ] Ability to query/filter by hull parameters and retrieve corresponding RAO graphs
- [ ] Documentation of hull form parametric ranges and analysis assumptions
