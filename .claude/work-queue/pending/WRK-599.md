## Summary

The 2026-02-25 folder-structure audit of digitalmodel and worldenergydata revealed a class of
issues not yet covered by the repo-structure or file-taxonomy skills: **non-Python files
loose in src/ package directories**.

## Findings

### worldenergydata src/
- `bsee/docs/infrastructure_data_catalog.md` — markdown doc inside src/ (VIOLATION)
- `bsee/sql/*.sql` — SQL query files in src/ (BORDERLINE — package resources OK if declared in pyproject.toml)
- `bsee/templates/*.html` — HTML templates in src/ (BORDERLINE — same as SQL)
- `vessel_fleet/configs/` — naming: should be `config/` (singular) to match repo conventions

### digitalmodel src/
- `specialized/gis/arcgis-2x.yml`, `arcgis.yml` — YAML config in src/ (should be `config/gis/`)
- `specialized/gis/GIS_2013-12-16-UTM_conv.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook in src/ (VIOLATION)
- `specialized/gis/` duplicates top-level `gis/` — dual competing GIS implementations

## Required Skill Updates

### repo-structure SKILL.md
Add enforcement rule: NEVER non-Python files in src/ Python package tree
- .md files -> docs/domains/<domain>/
- .ipynb files -> notebooks/<domain>/
- YAML config files -> config/<domain>/
- Exception: .sql and HTML templates that are package resources (accessed via importlib.resources)
  MUST be declared as package_data in pyproject.toml

### file-taxonomy SKILL.md
Add entry for SQL/HTML templates as package resources:
- "Is it a SQL query or HTML template used at runtime by a Python package?"
  -> keep in src/<pkg>/<domain>/ as package_data; declare in pyproject.toml
- Add distinction: package resource (in src/) vs runtime config (at config/) vs docs (at docs/)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] repo-structure SKILL.md has new enforcement rule for non-Python files in src/
- [ ] file-taxonomy SKILL.md has decision tree entry for package resources (SQL/HTML)
- [ ] Both skills specify where .md and .ipynb files belong when found in src/
