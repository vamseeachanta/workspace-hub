# Appliance Lifecycle Analytics Module for assethold

## What
Add an appliance lifecycle analysis capability to assethold that tracks and analyzes household/commercial appliances over their full lifecycle. The module should aggregate manufacturer data, maintenance history, repair ratings, and reliability scores sourced from online research. It should also provide geographic analysis of vendor-preferred appliance companies — answering how many preferred vendors exist in a given geographic area.

## Why
Property asset management requires understanding appliance health, replacement timing, and vendor availability. Tracking lifecycle data (manufacturer reliability, maintenance frequency, repair costs, vendor density) enables better capital planning, warranty tracking, and vendor selection for property portfolios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New module at `assethold/src/assethold/modules/appliances/` (or similar)
- [ ] Appliance data model covering: manufacturer, model, install date, expected lifespan, maintenance schedule, repair history, reliability rating
- [ ] Online research integration (web scraping or API) for manufacturer data, Consumer Reports-style ratings, and repair statistics
- [ ] Geographic vendor analysis: given a location, determine how many vendor-preferred appliance service companies operate in the area
- [ ] Lifecycle cost calculator: estimate total cost of ownership over appliance lifespan
- [ ] Data storage strategy (YAML/JSON/DB) for appliance inventory and vendor data
- [ ] Unit tests for data models, lifecycle calculations, and vendor lookup
- [ ] CLI or config-driven interface for querying appliance status and vendor counts
