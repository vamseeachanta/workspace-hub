# Ingest XLS Historical Rig Fleet Data (163 Deepwater Rigs)

## What
Parse and ingest 163 deepwater drilling rigs from the historical XLS reference files into the vessel_fleet pipeline. This was deferred from WRK-104 Step 2.

## Why
The XLS data contains ~80 fields per rig (vessel, riser, BOP, moonpool, drilling equipment, mud systems) for semisubs and drillships — significantly more detail than WAR or fleet page scrape data. These are the most data-rich rig records available and will improve spec completeness for deepwater vessels. Legal assessment: GREEN (163 public industry rigs, zero denied terms).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] XLS parser handles transposed layout (rig-per-column)
- [ ] Mixed format parsing: `"8,000 ft."`, `"20 x 40"`, `"DP2"`, `"Y/Yes/1.0"`
- [ ] ≥150 rigs output to `data/modules/vessel_fleet/raw/xls_historical/`
- [ ] Spot-check 5 rigs against source for field accuracy
- [ ] Merged into curated fleet via deduplicator (source priority: `xls_historical=4`)
- [ ] Unit tests for XLS parsing, format normalization, and output validation
- [ ] Hull dimensions (LOA, beam, draft, displacement) captured for RAO/diffraction mapping

## Plan
- Existing script: `scripts/vessel_fleet/ingest_xls_historical.py`
- Existing parser: `src/worldenergydata/vessel_fleet/parsers/xls.py`
- Master file: `DrillRigs.xls` (transposed layout: rig-per-column, needs transpose)
- Assessment: `worldenergydata/docs/data/rig-fleet-xls-assessment.md`
- 11/18 existing schema fields directly mappable, ~30 new fields recommended
