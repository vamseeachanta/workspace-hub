# Heavy vessel GIS integration — connect vessel dataset to GIS skill and BSEE pipeline

## What
Connect the heavy construction/installation vessel dataset (WRK-103) to the GIS skill (WRK-020) and BSEE field pipeline (WRK-239). Enable agents to query "which vessels operate in [field area]" as an integrated analysis step.

## Why
Vessel data and GIS capability exist independently. An integrated vessel-GIS-field query has direct value for project execution planning and field development analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `query_vessels_by_field_area(field_name)` callable via GIS skill
- [ ] Vessel data visualisable on a GIS map
- [ ] Integrated with BSEE pipeline output (WRK-239)
- [ ] Tested with 2 GoM field areas

## Agentic AI Horizon
- High value for project execution planning — agents can recommend available vessels for a given field area
- Blocked by WRK-020 (GIS skill, pending); vessel data and BSEE pipeline are ready
- **Disposition: do after WRK-020 ships** — blocked by GIS skill; groundwork (data mapping design) can begin now
