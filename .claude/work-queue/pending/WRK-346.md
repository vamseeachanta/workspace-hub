# Fix aceengineer-admin to standard src/ layout

## What
Move `aceengineer_admin/` and `aceengineer_automation/` from repo root into `src/`,
matching the `src/` layout standard used by all other Python repos in the ecosystem.

## Why
Tier-1 consistency review (2026-02-23): `aceengineer-admin` is the only Python repo
with packages at root level. This breaks the pattern expected by all other repos and
makes the project harder to reason about (business documents mixed with code at root).

## Scope
- `git mv aceengineer_admin/ src/aceengineer_admin/`
- `git mv aceengineer_automation/ src/aceengineer_automation/`
- Update `pyproject.toml`:
  - Add `[tool.setuptools.packages.find] where = ["src"]`
  - Remove setup.py (if present) or ensure pyproject.toml is canonical
- Verify entry point `aceengineer = "aceengineer_admin.cli:main"` still resolves

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `src/aceengineer_admin/` exists with all original content
- [ ] `src/aceengineer_automation/` exists with all original content
- [ ] Repo root no longer has `aceengineer_admin/` or `aceengineer_automation/`
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` uses `where = ["src"]` package discovery
- [ ] `pip install -e .` works in aceengineer-admin
- [ ] Entry point `aceengineer` resolves correctly

## Notes
- Business data folders (CapitalOne, invoices, etc.) remain at root — they are not packages
- `src/` directory already exists but is empty — use it
