# Standardize Analysis Reporting for Each OrcaFlex Structure Type

## What
Create a standardized reporting framework for OrcaFlex analysis outputs, with per-structure-type report templates. Each structure type (pipeline, riser, jumper, mooring, installation, vessel) gets a dedicated HTML report with consistent format, standard plots, summary tables, and pass/fail checks against design criteria.

## Why
- Currently no standardized output format — results are ad-hoc scripts or raw JSON/YAML
- Engineers need consistent, auditable reports for each analysis type
- Standard templates reduce post-processing effort and ensure nothing is missed
- HTML reports (Plotly) are the project convention — interactive, self-contained, shareable
- Enables automated QA: standard outputs mean standard validation checks

## Scope
1. **Define standard output schema per structure type** — what results does each analysis produce?
2. **Report templates** — HTML report per structure type with consistent layout
3. **Standard plots** — Plotly interactive charts for each result type (time histories, envelopes, utilization)
4. **Summary tables** — key results, design checks, pass/fail status
5. **Report generator API** — `generate_report(model, results, structure_type) → HTML`
6. **Integration with existing benchmark pipeline** — reports auto-generated after analysis

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Standard output schema defined for at least 4 structure types (pipeline, riser, mooring, jumper)
- [ ] HTML report template for each structure type with consistent header, metadata, plots, tables
- [ ] Plotly interactive plots: time histories, statistical summaries, utilization envelopes, max/min tables
- [ ] Pass/fail design checks embedded in reports (e.g., tension > 0, utilization < 1.0)
- [ ] Report generator callable from scripts and integrated into benchmark pipeline
- [ ] Reports self-contained (single HTML file with embedded Plotly CDN)
- [ ] At least 2 example reports generated from existing benchmark models
