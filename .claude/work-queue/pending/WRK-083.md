# Validate multi-format export (Excel, PDF, Parquet) with real BSEE data

## What
Test and fix Excel, PDF, and Parquet export paths using real BSEE production data. HTML export works. The other formats have infrastructure but unclear if they produce valid output with real data.

## Why
Website markets "Multi-format export (Excel, JSON, HTML, PDF, Parquet)" as a core feature. HTML is confirmed working; others need validation to ensure the claim holds.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Excel export produces valid .xlsx with real BSEE production data
- [ ] PDF export produces valid .pdf with formatted tables and charts
- [ ] Parquet export produces valid .parquet readable by pandas/polars
- [ ] JSON export produces valid structured JSON
- [ ] Each format tested with at least one BSEE field dataset
- [ ] Export manager has integration tests for all formats
