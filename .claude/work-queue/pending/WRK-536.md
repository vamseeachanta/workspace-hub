# feat(doris/pipeline): Implement DNV F109 — DNV RP F109 (2007) On-bottom stability design of s

## Standard
- **Standard**: DNV F109
- **Full title**: DNV RP F109 (2007) On-bottom stability design of submarine pipelines
- **Domain**: pipeline
- **Document path**: `/mnt/ace/0000 O&G/0000 Codes & Standards/DNV/DNV Recommended Practices/DNV RP F109/DNV RP F109 (2007) On-bottom stability design of submarine pipelines.pdf`

## What

Implement engineering calculations and data models from **DNV F109**
in the `doris` repository, module `pipeline`.

This standard was identified in Phase C/E of WRK-309 (Document Intelligence)
as a gap — the document exists on the drives but its content has not been
implemented in the target repo.

## Why

**DNV F109** is a key industry standard in the `pipeline` domain.
Implementing its calculations enables agents and engineers to perform
rigorous code-compliant analysis directly from the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core calculations / design checks implemented with unit tests
- [ ] Input validation at parameter boundaries
- [ ] Docstring cites the standard clause/equation numbers
- [ ] Example usage verified against standard worked example (if available)
- [ ] Cross-review passed via `scripts/review/cross-review.sh`
