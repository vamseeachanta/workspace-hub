# chore(workspace-hub): Normalize SKILL.md Frontmatter for 9 Skipped Skills

## Goal

Eliminate skill-loader warnings caused by invalid or missing YAML frontmatter so all
9 currently skipped skills load successfully.

## Current State

- Skill loader reports 9 skipped `SKILL.md` files.
- Failure modes:
  - Missing frontmatter (`---` block): 2 files
  - YAML syntax errors: 3 files
  - Missing required `name` field: 4 files

## Scope

Fix only metadata/frontmatter validity for these files:

1. `.claude/skills/digitalmodel/module-lookup/SKILL.md`
2. `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/document-batch/SKILL.md`
3. `.claude/skills/data/energy/bsee-data-extractor/SKILL.md`
4. `.claude/skills/data/energy/npv-analyzer/SKILL.md`
5. `.claude/skills/data/energy/production-forecaster/SKILL.md`
6. `.claude/skills/_diverged/worldenergydata/optimization/model-selection/SKILL.md`
7. `.claude/skills/_diverged/worldenergydata/optimization/usage-optimization/SKILL.md`
8. `.claude/skills/_diverged/worldenergydata/product/product-roadmap/SKILL.md`
9. `.claude/skills/_diverged/worldenergydata/_internal/meta/python-code-refactor/SKILL.md`

Out of scope: changing skill behavior, scripts, or capability content beyond metadata
needed for parser acceptance.

## Plan (GOAP, Route A/B)

### Route A (Primary: targeted metadata repair)

1. Inspect each file's existing header/body and infer intended `name`, `description`,
   `version`, `category`, and `type` values from neighboring skills.
2. Add/repair YAML frontmatter with valid delimiters and syntax.
3. Ensure required keys are present (`name` at minimum for all 9).
4. Run skill validation/loading command and confirm skipped count drops from 9 to 0.
5. Capture before/after evidence in WRK notes.

### Route B (Fallback: standardized skeleton then preserve body)

Use if a file header is too malformed to safely patch inline.

1. Replace broken header with minimal canonical frontmatter template.
2. Preserve the full existing markdown body unchanged below frontmatter.
3. Re-run validator and iterate until all 9 pass.

## Preconditions

- WRK approval explicitly naming `WRK-577`.
- No bulk refactor across unrelated skills.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 9 listed `SKILL.md` files parse as valid YAML frontmatter.
- [ ] Required `name` field present in all 9 files.
- [ ] Skill loader/validator reports `0` skipped skills for this issue set.
- [ ] No content regressions outside metadata normalization.
- [ ] Changes limited to scoped files (+ index/work-queue bookkeeping).

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Wrong `name` choice could affect skill lookup.
  - Mitigation: Align `name` with directory slug and sibling skill conventions.
- Risk: Hidden parser requirements beyond `name`.
  - Mitigation: Validate after each batch and patch incrementally.

## Cross-Review Requirement

Before marking complete, run cross-review and resolve any `MAJOR` verdicts per
Workspace Hub gate policy.
