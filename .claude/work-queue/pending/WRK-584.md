# Index NSTA UK National Data Repository Datasets

## What

Index available datasets from the NSTA UK National Data Repository
(400+ GB of freely available UK North Sea exploration data) and add
to worldenergydata.

## Why

The NSTA NDR contains seismic, well, and geological data for the UK
Continental Shelf. December 2025 carbon storage licensing round opened
new datasets. This is a high-value open data source not yet ingested.

## Deliverables

- Dataset index: list of available datasets with metadata
- Priority ranking by relevance to existing modules
- Integration plan for top datasets

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] NSTA NDR portal crawled for dataset inventory
- [ ] Each dataset catalogued: name, type, size, format, relevance
- [ ] Top 10 datasets identified for worldenergydata integration
- [ ] Integration plan documented
