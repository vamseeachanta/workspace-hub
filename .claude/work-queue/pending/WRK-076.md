# Add data collection scheduler/orchestrator for automated refresh pipelines

## What
Implement cron-style or task-queue automation for data refresh pipelines. Currently all data collection requires manual CLI invocation. The website claims "automated collection" and "real-time data refresh with smart caching" — this needs to be true.

## Why
Manual-only data collection contradicts the website's marketing claims. A scheduler enables "set and forget" data pipelines, which is the core value proposition for data-as-a-service clients.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scheduler can run BSEE, SODIR, and Canada data refresh on configurable intervals
- [ ] Supports cron-like scheduling (daily, weekly, monthly)
- [ ] Logging and alerting on failures
- [ ] Idempotent — safe to re-run without data corruption
- [ ] CLI command to start/stop/status the scheduler
- [ ] Configuration via YAML
- [ ] Works as background service or systemd unit
