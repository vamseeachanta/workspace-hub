## Context

The current `/work` skill surfaces WRK item IDs only (e.g., WRK-123, WRK-456).
Users need richer context at a glance to decide what to work on next without
opening individual files.

## Goal

Enhance the work skill's item presentation format to include title, priority,
goal summary, blockers, and recommended next action for each item.

## Desired Output Format

```
WRK-123 [HIGH] feat(worldenergydata): add Arps decline curve API endpoint
  Goal: Expose decline curve forecasting via REST API for dashboard integration
  Blockers: none
  Recommended: implement endpoint; tests first (TDD)

WRK-456 [LOW] chore: update assetutilities dependencies
  Goal: Bump pandas, numpy to latest compatible versions
  Blockers: WRK-350 (test failures) — resolve first
  Recommended: hold until WRK-350 is done
```

## Steps

1. Review current work skill implementation at `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/work/`
2. Add frontmatter parsing (id, title, priority, tags)
3. Extract first sentence of `## Goal` or `## Context` for summary
4. Detect blockers from frontmatter `blocked_by:` field
5. Emit formatted output; keep concise (≤4 lines per item)
6. Add `--brief` flag for ID-only output (preserve current behaviour)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Each WRK item in list shows: ID, priority, title (truncated at 80 chars), goal, blockers, recommendation
- [x] `--brief` flag restores ID-only output
- [x] No performance regression (< 2s for 50 items)
