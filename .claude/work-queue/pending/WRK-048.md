# Blender working configurations for digitalmodel

## What
Establish working Blender configurations within digitalmodel — setup files, scene templates, and configuration presets for marine/offshore engineering visualisation and 3D modelling workflows.

## Why
Having standardised Blender configurations ensures consistent 3D visualisation output, streamlines scene setup for engineering models, and enables repeatable rendering workflows for client deliverables and technical presentations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Working Blender configuration files established
- [ ] Scene templates for relevant engineering visualisation use cases
- [ ] Configuration presets documented and version-controlled
- [ ] Integration with digitalmodel project structure
- [ ] Documentation of setup and usage
