# Compile global LNG terminal project dataset with comprehensive parameters

## What
Research and compile a dataset of LNG terminal projects around the world, capturing key parameters: water depth, environmental data, budget, capacity, and any other obtainable project parameters.

## Why
A comprehensive LNG terminal dataset supports market intelligence, benchmarking, and engineering reference for offshore/marine energy projects. Having structured data on global terminals enables comparison across regions, identification of trends, and informed decision-making for new project development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Global coverage of LNG terminal projects (operational, under construction, planned)
- [x] Key parameters captured per terminal:
  - Water depth
  - Environmental/metocean data (where available)
  - Budget / capital expenditure
  - Capacity (MTPA)
  - Location (country, coordinates)
  - Terminal type (onshore, offshore, FSRU, FLNG)
  - Operator / owner
  - Status (operational, construction, planned, decommissioned)
  - Year commissioned / expected commissioning
- [x] Additional parameters where obtainable (jetty details, storage, throughput, EPC contractor, etc.)
- [x] Data sourced from publicly available references (cited)
- [x] Structured format suitable for analysis (CSV/parquet/database)
- [x] Data quality notes (completeness, source reliability)
- [x] Documentation of data schema and sources

## Plan

**Target**: `src/worldenergydata/lng_terminals/` (use existing module — `lng_terminals/` already has analysis, collectors, config, models)

### Phase 1 — Data Schema
- Reconcile with existing `lng_terminals/models/` — extend or replace existing data models
- Confirm GIIGNL usage rights and citation requirements before parsing
- `terminal_schema.py` — Pydantic model for LNG terminal:
  - Data lineage: `source` field per terminal, `source_confidence` rating
  - Identity: name, country, coordinates, operator, owner
  - Technical: type (onshore/offshore/FSRU/FLNG), capacity_mtpa, storage_m3, jetty_count
  - Environment: water_depth_m, metocean_zone, seismic_zone
  - Financial: capex_usd, opex_usd_annual (where available)
  - Timeline: status (operational/construction/planned/decommissioned), year_commissioned, year_decommissioned
  - Additional: EPC contractor, berth count, throughput, regasification/liquefaction
- `data_quality.py` — Completeness scoring per record

### Phase 2a — Manual Seed Data (top 50 terminals)
- Manually compile top 50 terminals from Wikipedia/public lists and FERC (US terminals)
- Ensures useful data exists even if automated parsing fails
- Minimum dataset target: 200 terminals globally

### Phase 2b — Semi-Automated Enrichment
- `sources.py` — Catalog of public data sources:
  - GIIGNL annual report (global LNG database, free PDF — verify usage rights first)
  - IEA gas information (may require subscription)
  - FERC LNG terminal data (US terminals)
  - Industry press: LNG World Shipping, Riviera Maritime
  - Wikipedia LNG terminal lists (starting point for cross-referencing)
- `terminal_acquirer.py` — Semi-automated collection:
  - Parse GIIGNL PDF tables (note: multi-page tables with merged cells — may require dedicated sub-task for robust extraction)
  - Scrape FERC LNG terminal data
  - Manual enrichment via defined workflow checklist (not ad-hoc)

### Phase 3 — Data Storage & Analysis
- Store as CSV/Parquet + optional SQLite
- Analysis scripts: capacity by region, type distribution, trend over time, capex benchmarking
- Plotly map: global terminal locations color-coded by type/status

### Phase 4 — Tests
- Schema validation tests
- Data quality score calculations
- Known terminal spot-checks (e.g., Sabine Pass: 30 MTPA, operational)

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MAJOR | Gemini: MINOR
- **Actions taken**:
  - Fixed target path from `lng/terminals/` to `lng_terminals/` (existing module)
  - Added reconciliation with existing `lng_terminals/models/` in Phase 1
  - Split Phase 2 into 2a (manual seed data, top 50) and 2b (semi-automated enrichment)
  - Added GIIGNL usage rights verification as prerequisite
  - Added data lineage field and source confidence rating per Codex feedback
  - Added minimum dataset target (200 terminals globally)
  - Noted PDF parsing complexity as potential dedicated sub-task
  - Replaced ad-hoc "manual enrichment" with defined workflow checklist

## Implementation Notes (2026-02-16)

### Module Status: Pre-existing & Comprehensive
The `lng_terminals` module was already architecturally complete before this work item:
- **Models**: `LNGTerminal` Pydantic model with 25+ fields, sub-models (HullDesign, PipelineSpec, ProcessEquipment, StorageSpec, MarineInfrastructure), QualityScore, SourceCitation
- **Collectors**: BaseCollector ABC + SeedCollector (119 embedded), FERCCollector, GIECollector, GIIGNLCollector, WebCollector
- **Processors**: Normalizer (country codes, units), Deduplicator (fuzzy match), Enricher (priority merge), QualityScorer
- **Exporters**: CSV (flattened) + Parquet
- **Analysis**: CapacityAnalysis (regional summaries), TimelineAnalysis (commissioning trends)
- **Reports**: QualityDashboard (HTML), TerminalMap (SVG/Plotly)
- **CLI**: collect/process/export/report/pipeline commands
- **Config**: `config/lng_terminals.yml` with scraper, cache, processing settings
- **Tests**: 188 tests in 14 test modules, all passing

### Data Expansion (this session)
Expanded curated seed dataset from 75 → **227 terminals** across **68 countries**:

| Region | Terminals | Key Additions |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| China | +24 | CNOOC (9), PetroChina (2), Sinopec (4), private (5), under construction (4) |
| Japan | +29 | JERA, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas, Kyushu/Saibu Gas, regional utilities |
| South Korea | +2 | Gwangyang (POSCO), Boryeong (SK E&S) |
| India | +7 | Hazira, Ennore, Mundra, Dhamra, Chhara + 2 FSRUs under construction |
| Southeast Asia | +9 | Vietnam (2), Philippines (2), Indonesia FSRUs (5) |
| Europe | +15 | Spain (3), Italy (2), Germany (1), Turkey (4), Finland, Croatia, NL, Greece |
| Americas | +13 | USA (1), Chile (2), Colombia, Brazil (6), Panama, Jamaica, DR, Puerto Rico |
| Africa/ME | from seed | Already had strong coverage from seed collector |

**Coverage stats**: 185 operational, 23 under construction, 8 planned, 2 proposed, 9 mothballed/other
**Coordinate coverage**: 215/227 (94.7%)
**Type breakdown**: onshore_import 111, onshore_export 43, FSRU 38, FLNG 26, onshore_liquefaction 9

### Data Sources
- Global Energy Monitor (GEM) — primary for China, Japan, SE Asia terminals
- GIIGNL Annual Report — capacity cross-referencing
- FERC LNG Reports — US terminals (rich data: coordinates, water depth, storage, capex)
- Operator public filings — Cheniere, QatarEnergy, PETRONAS, Shell, etc.
- Wikipedia LNG terminal lists — starting point for cross-referencing

### Data Catalog
Added `lng_terminals` module to `data/catalog/data-catalog.yml` (10th module, 246 datasets)

### Files Modified
- `data/modules/lng_terminals/curated/terminals_seed.csv` — 75 → 227 terminals
- `data/catalog/data-catalog.yml` — added lng_terminals module entry
- `scripts/expand_seed_csv.py` — one-time CSV generation script
- `scripts/merge_seed_csv.py` — one-time CSV merge + coordinate enrichment script

### Potential Skill Spin-offs
1. **LNG Terminal Research Agent** — automates web research for new terminals by region, validates against existing dataset, adds coordinates. Would avoid re-doing the manual research each time the dataset needs updating.
2. **GIIGNL PDF Parser** — dedicated skill for parsing GIIGNL annual report PDFs (multi-page tables with merged cells). Would unlock automated enrichment of the entire global fleet.
3. **Coordinate Enrichment Skill** — given a terminal name + country, looks up approximate coordinates from public sources. Reusable across any geo-dataset module.
4. **Data Catalog Updater** — automatically updates data-catalog.yml when datasets change (row counts, file sizes, column lists).

### Test Results
188/188 tests passing (77s), including:
- Schema validation, model tests, enum tests
- Collector lifecycle tests (seed, FERC, web)
- Normalizer, deduplicator, enricher tests
- Quality scorer, exporter tests
- Geographic distribution (19 US, 6 ME, 10 AUS)
- Coordinate coverage (94.7% >= 80% threshold)
- Known terminal spot-checks (Sabine Pass 30 MTPA, Gorgon, Hammerfest, Cove Point)
