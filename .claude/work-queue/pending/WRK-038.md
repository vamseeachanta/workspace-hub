# Compile global LNG terminal project dataset with comprehensive parameters

## What
Research and compile a dataset of LNG terminal projects around the world, capturing key parameters: water depth, environmental data, budget, capacity, and any other obtainable project parameters.

## Why
A comprehensive LNG terminal dataset supports market intelligence, benchmarking, and engineering reference for offshore/marine energy projects. Having structured data on global terminals enables comparison across regions, identification of trends, and informed decision-making for new project development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Global coverage of LNG terminal projects (operational, under construction, planned)
- [ ] Key parameters captured per terminal:
  - Water depth
  - Environmental/metocean data (where available)
  - Budget / capital expenditure
  - Capacity (MTPA)
  - Location (country, coordinates)
  - Terminal type (onshore, offshore, FSRU, FLNG)
  - Operator / owner
  - Status (operational, construction, planned, decommissioned)
  - Year commissioned / expected commissioning
- [ ] Additional parameters where obtainable (jetty details, storage, throughput, EPC contractor, etc.)
- [ ] Data sourced from publicly available references (cited)
- [ ] Structured format suitable for analysis (CSV/parquet/database)
- [ ] Data quality notes (completeness, source reliability)
- [ ] Documentation of data schema and sources
