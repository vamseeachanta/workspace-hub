# Compile global LNG terminal project dataset with comprehensive parameters

## What
Research and compile a dataset of LNG terminal projects around the world, capturing key parameters: water depth, environmental data, budget, capacity, and any other obtainable project parameters.

## Why
A comprehensive LNG terminal dataset supports market intelligence, benchmarking, and engineering reference for offshore/marine energy projects. Having structured data on global terminals enables comparison across regions, identification of trends, and informed decision-making for new project development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Global coverage of LNG terminal projects (operational, under construction, planned)
- [ ] Key parameters captured per terminal:
  - Water depth
  - Environmental/metocean data (where available)
  - Budget / capital expenditure
  - Capacity (MTPA)
  - Location (country, coordinates)
  - Terminal type (onshore, offshore, FSRU, FLNG)
  - Operator / owner
  - Status (operational, construction, planned, decommissioned)
  - Year commissioned / expected commissioning
- [ ] Additional parameters where obtainable (jetty details, storage, throughput, EPC contractor, etc.)
- [ ] Data sourced from publicly available references (cited)
- [ ] Structured format suitable for analysis (CSV/parquet/database)
- [ ] Data quality notes (completeness, source reliability)
- [ ] Documentation of data schema and sources

## Plan

**Target**: `src/worldenergydata/lng_terminals/` (use existing module — `lng_terminals/` already has analysis, collectors, config, models)

### Phase 1 — Data Schema
- Reconcile with existing `lng_terminals/models/` — extend or replace existing data models
- Confirm GIIGNL usage rights and citation requirements before parsing
- `terminal_schema.py` — Pydantic model for LNG terminal:
  - Data lineage: `source` field per terminal, `source_confidence` rating
  - Identity: name, country, coordinates, operator, owner
  - Technical: type (onshore/offshore/FSRU/FLNG), capacity_mtpa, storage_m3, jetty_count
  - Environment: water_depth_m, metocean_zone, seismic_zone
  - Financial: capex_usd, opex_usd_annual (where available)
  - Timeline: status (operational/construction/planned/decommissioned), year_commissioned, year_decommissioned
  - Additional: EPC contractor, berth count, throughput, regasification/liquefaction
- `data_quality.py` — Completeness scoring per record

### Phase 2a — Manual Seed Data (top 50 terminals)
- Manually compile top 50 terminals from Wikipedia/public lists and FERC (US terminals)
- Ensures useful data exists even if automated parsing fails
- Minimum dataset target: 200 terminals globally

### Phase 2b — Semi-Automated Enrichment
- `sources.py` — Catalog of public data sources:
  - GIIGNL annual report (global LNG database, free PDF — verify usage rights first)
  - IEA gas information (may require subscription)
  - FERC LNG terminal data (US terminals)
  - Industry press: LNG World Shipping, Riviera Maritime
  - Wikipedia LNG terminal lists (starting point for cross-referencing)
- `terminal_acquirer.py` — Semi-automated collection:
  - Parse GIIGNL PDF tables (note: multi-page tables with merged cells — may require dedicated sub-task for robust extraction)
  - Scrape FERC LNG terminal data
  - Manual enrichment via defined workflow checklist (not ad-hoc)

### Phase 3 — Data Storage & Analysis
- Store as CSV/Parquet + optional SQLite
- Analysis scripts: capacity by region, type distribution, trend over time, capex benchmarking
- Plotly map: global terminal locations color-coded by type/status

### Phase 4 — Tests
- Schema validation tests
- Data quality score calculations
- Known terminal spot-checks (e.g., Sabine Pass: 30 MTPA, operational)

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MAJOR | Gemini: MINOR
- **Actions taken**:
  - Fixed target path from `lng/terminals/` to `lng_terminals/` (existing module)
  - Added reconciliation with existing `lng_terminals/models/` in Phase 1
  - Split Phase 2 into 2a (manual seed data, top 50) and 2b (semi-automated enrichment)
  - Added GIIGNL usage rights verification as prerequisite
  - Added data lineage field and source confidence rating per Codex feedback
  - Added minimum dataset target (200 terminals globally)
  - Noted PDF parsing complexity as potential dedicated sub-task
  - Replaced ad-hoc "manual enrichment" with defined workflow checklist
