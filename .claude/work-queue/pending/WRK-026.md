# AQWA Modular File Preparation

## What
Build a modular file preparation system for AQWA input files. Support both individual Deck files (per analysis component) and combined files that merge decks into a single run file. The structure should allow reuse of common deck sections across analyses.

## Why
AQWA input files are complex and error-prone when manually assembled. A modular structure (separate deck files that compose into combined files) enables reuse, reduces errors, and supports parametric studies where only specific decks change between runs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deck file abstraction (geometry, mesh, loading, boundary conditions, solver settings)
- [ ] Deck composition/merge into combined AQWA input files
- [ ] Template system for common deck patterns
- [ ] Validation of deck compatibility before combining
- [ ] Support for parametric variation across deck files
- [ ] Clear file naming convention and directory structure
