# Agent coordination model ADR — document architectural decision record

## What
Write a decision record (ADR-style) for "agent coordination model choice" — why workspace-hub agent skills are used instead of Codex native roles (WRK-213 finding). Add to `.claude/docs/decisions/`. Reference from the agent-library README.

## Why
The Codex multi-agent roles assessment was done (WRK-213) but the outcome lives only in the WRK file. Future sessions re-evaluate the same question. An ADR prevents repeated re-evaluation of settled architectural questions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR written at `.claude/docs/decisions/ADR-001-agent-coordination-model.md`
- [ ] Covers: decision, alternatives considered, rationale, and consequences
- [ ] Referenced from `.claude/agent-library/README.md`

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Prevents repeated agent effort re-litigating settled architectural decisions
- Pure knowledge preservation work; agents can help draft but a human must approve the rationale
- **Disposition: do now** — low effort, high knowledge-preservation value; 30-minute task
