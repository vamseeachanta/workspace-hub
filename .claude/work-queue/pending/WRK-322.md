# Fundamentals scoring — P/E P/B EV/EBITDA ranking from yfinance

## What

Integrate fundamental scoring into the assethold portfolio strategy. Pull P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA
from yfinance for each holding. Score and rank within sector peers. Output: scored holdings
table, flag deep-value opportunities.

## Why

The current assethold strategy focuses on price-based signals. Adding fundamental scoring
(valuation multiples relative to sector peers) provides a complementary value lens. Flagging
deep-value opportunities within the existing portfolio supports rebalancing decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] yfinance fundamentals data pull: P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, dividend yield for each holding
- [x] Sector peer grouping using GICS sector classification
- [x] Percentile ranking within sector peers for each metric
- [x] Composite value score (configurable weighting of metrics)
- [x] Deep-value flag: composite score in bottom quintile of sector
- [x] Output: scored holdings table (CSV and console)
- [x] Wire into existing daily strategy report
- [x] Pytest coverage with mocked yfinance responses
