# Fundamentals scoring — P/E P/B EV/EBITDA ranking from yfinance

## What

Integrate fundamental scoring into the assethold portfolio strategy. Pull P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA
from yfinance for each holding. Score and rank within sector peers. Output: scored holdings
table, flag deep-value opportunities.

## Why

The current assethold strategy focuses on price-based signals. Adding fundamental scoring
(valuation multiples relative to sector peers) provides a complementary value lens. Flagging
deep-value opportunities within the existing portfolio supports rebalancing decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] yfinance fundamentals data pull: P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, dividend yield for each holding
- [ ] Sector peer grouping using GICS sector classification
- [ ] Percentile ranking within sector peers for each metric
- [ ] Composite value score (configurable weighting of metrics)
- [ ] Deep-value flag: composite score in bottom quintile of sector
- [ ] Output: scored holdings table (CSV and console)
- [ ] Wire into existing daily strategy report
- [ ] Pytest coverage with mocked yfinance responses
