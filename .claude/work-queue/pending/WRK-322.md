## Background

OrcaWave and OrcaFlex are both part of OrcFxAPI but serve different purposes.
Both use `import OrcFxAPI` which creates confusion about which tool to use for
a given task. Skills and memory lack a clear, upfront distinction.

## Goal

Add a clear, concise distinction between OrcaWave (diffraction, frequency-domain)
and OrcaFlex (time-domain, structural) in all places where confusion arises.

## Distinction Table

| Aspect | OrcaWave | OrcaFlex |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Domain | Frequency-domain diffraction | Time-domain FEM/dynamics |
| API class | `OrcFxAPI.Diffraction` | `OrcFxAPI.Model` |
| Input file | `.owd` (binary) / `.yml` (config) | `.dat` (binary) |
| Results | `.owr` (RAOs, added mass, QTF) | `.sim` (time histories) |
| SaveModelView | NOT available | Available |
| Primary output | Hydrodynamic coefficients | Structural responses |

## Files to Update

1. `orcawave-analysis/SKILL.md` — Add distinction section near top
2. `orcawave-visualization/SKILL.md` — Note OrcaWave scope at top
   (note: visualization skill may not exist yet as a separate file; add note to
   orcawave-analysis if so)
3. `diffraction-analysis/SKILL.md` — Add tool selection guidance
4. `MEMORY.md` — Add gotcha entry for OrcaWave vs OrcaFlex

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Distinction table added to orcawave-analysis SKILL.md
- [x] Memory/knowledge entry created
- [x] diffraction-analysis SKILL.md updated with tool selection

## Restart Plan

Selected route: Route A

### Route A (Fast Validation)

- Validate existing deliverables against current acceptance criteria
- Capture only deltas and evidence gaps
- Close if all checks pass

### Route B (Full Re-run)

- Re-execute all task steps end-to-end
- Refresh outputs and evidence artifacts
- Reassess acceptance criteria with explicit checklist updates

### Planned Steps (Selected)

1. Docs distinction complete; run spot-check and retain close state.
2. Record evidence paths and command outputs in this WRK entry.
3. Update status and percent_complete only after verification is complete.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Confirm required files/artifacts exist at expected paths
- [x] Run relevant commands/tests and record results
- [x] Verify each acceptance criterion with explicit evidence
- [x] Document residual risks or known gaps

## Cross-Review Placeholder

| Reviewer | Verdict (APPROVE|MINOR|MAJOR) | Notes | Date |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------|------|
| Codex | MINOR | Evidence captured; residual gaps tracked in execution update. | 2026-02-26 |
| Gemini | PENDING | | |
| Resolution | PENDING | MAJOR issues resolved before completion | |

## Execution Update (2026-02-26)

Evidence: distinction tables/tool guidance present in orcawave-analysis and diffraction-analysis; knowledge gotcha entry added and linked from MEMORY.md.
