## Background

OrcaWave and OrcaFlex are both part of OrcFxAPI but serve different purposes.
Both use `import OrcFxAPI` which creates confusion about which tool to use for
a given task. Skills and memory lack a clear, upfront distinction.

## Goal

Add a clear, concise distinction between OrcaWave (diffraction, frequency-domain)
and OrcaFlex (time-domain, structural) in all places where confusion arises.

## Distinction Table

| Aspect | OrcaWave | OrcaFlex |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Domain | Frequency-domain diffraction | Time-domain FEM/dynamics |
| API class | `OrcFxAPI.Diffraction` | `OrcFxAPI.Model` |
| Input file | `.owd` (binary) / `.yml` (config) | `.dat` (binary) |
| Results | `.owr` (RAOs, added mass, QTF) | `.sim` (time histories) |
| SaveModelView | NOT available | Available |
| Primary output | Hydrodynamic coefficients | Structural responses |

## Files to Update

1. `orcawave-analysis/SKILL.md` — Add distinction section near top
2. `orcawave-visualization/SKILL.md` — Note OrcaWave scope at top
   (note: visualization skill may not exist yet as a separate file; add note to
   orcawave-analysis if so)
3. `diffraction-analysis/SKILL.md` — Add tool selection guidance
4. `MEMORY.md` — Add gotcha entry for OrcaWave vs OrcaFlex

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Distinction table added to orcawave-analysis SKILL.md
- [ ] Memory/knowledge entry created
- [ ] diffraction-analysis SKILL.md updated with tool selection
