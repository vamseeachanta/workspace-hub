# On-Bottom Stability (Phase 3)

## What

Implement pipeline on-bottom stability assessment per DNV-RP-F109 (2021),
covering absolute and generalized lateral stability methods, soil passive
resistance models, and seabed pipeline Morison hydrodynamic loads.

## Why

No open-source DNV-RP-F109 implementation exists. The lateral_buckling
module currently uses constant friction coefficients — Phase 3 provides
physically-derived friction from soil properties. Also feeds WRK-478
(CP anode sled OBS checks).

## Scope

### Packages
- None — entirely custom (no open-source F109 implementation exists)

### Standards
- DNV-RP-F109 (2021)

## Deliverables

- `geotechnical/on_bottom_stability/absolute_stability.py` — F109 Sec 3.3
- `geotechnical/on_bottom_stability/generalized_stability.py` — F109 Sec 3.4
- `geotechnical/on_bottom_stability/soil_resistance.py` — passive resistance, Coulomb (clay/sand)
- `geotechnical/on_bottom_stability/hydro_loads.py` — seabed pipeline Morison loads
- Test suite validated against DNV-RP-F109 Appendix B design examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Absolute lateral stability method per F109 Sec 3.3
- [ ] Generalized lateral stability method per F109 Sec 3.4
- [ ] Soil passive resistance for clay and sand (Coulomb model)
- [ ] Seabed pipeline Morison hydrodynamic load calculation
- [ ] Tests validated against DNV-RP-F109 Appendix B examples
- [ ] Cross-review passes (Codex hard gate)
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Integration Points

- **lateral_buckling.py** (line 52-61): replace constant friction_cfg with
  physically-derived soil friction coefficients
- **WRK-478** (Cathodic Protection): anode sled on-bottom stability checks
