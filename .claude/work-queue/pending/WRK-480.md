# feat(worldenergydata): integrate CMEMS Wave Multi-Year Product

## Objective
Integrate the CMEMS Wave Multi-Year (1967-2025) hindcast into the `metocean` module.

## Context
This product provides a 58-year wave climate baseline, which is critical for extreme wave statistics and return period calculations. It complements ERA5 with dedicated ocean-wave physics.

## Plan
1. Implement CMEMS Marine Service data downloader.
2. Integrate the wave multi-year product into the metocean analysis pipeline.
3. Update extreme value analysis (EVA) modules to utilize this longer baseline.
4. Verify results against ERA5 benchmarks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Successful ingestion of CMEMS wave data.
- EVA results improved by longer historical baseline.
