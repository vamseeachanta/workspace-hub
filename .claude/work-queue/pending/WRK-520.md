# feat(doris/pipeline): Implement DNV F201 — DNV OS F201 (2010) Dynamic Risers

## Standard
- **Standard**: DNV F201
- **Full title**: DNV OS F201 (2010) Dynamic Risers
- **Domain**: pipeline
- **Document path**: `/mnt/ace/0000 O&G/0000 Codes & Standards/DNV/DNV Offshore Standard/DNV OS F201/DNV OS F201 (2010) Dynamic Risers.pdf`

## What

Implement engineering calculations and data models from **DNV F201**
in the `doris` repository, module `pipeline`.

This standard was identified in Phase C/E of WRK-309 (Document Intelligence)
as a gap — the document exists on the drives but its content has not been
implemented in the target repo.

## Why

**DNV F201** is a key industry standard in the `pipeline` domain.
Implementing its calculations enables agents and engineers to perform
rigorous code-compliant analysis directly from the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core calculations / design checks implemented with unit tests
- [ ] Input validation at parameter boundaries
- [ ] Docstring cites the standard clause/equation numbers
- [ ] Example usage verified against standard worked example (if available)
- [ ] Cross-review passed via `scripts/review/cross-review.sh`
