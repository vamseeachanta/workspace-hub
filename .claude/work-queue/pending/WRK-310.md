# explore: OrcFxAPI schematic capture for OrcaWave models (program screenshots)

## Context

The 3.1 benchmark report now has an interactive Plotly Mesh3d visualization
(body panels + free-surface zone). For human comfort and consistency across
viewers (printed PDFs, slide decks, stakeholders without a browser), static
program-generated screenshots are highly valuable — keeping the view consistent
regardless of how the report is consumed.

OrcaFlex uses `Model.SaveModelView(path, viewParameters)` for programmatic
screenshot capture. OrcaWave uses `OrcFxAPI.Diffraction` which has NO equivalent
`SaveModelView`. This item explores what is actually feasible.

## What to Explore

### 1. OrcFxAPI.Diffraction view-related attributes
- List all attributes/methods of a loaded `Diffraction` object
- Look for any `View`, `Save`, `Screenshot`, `Export`, `Render` methods
- Check OrcFxAPI Python wrapper docs/changelog for recent additions

### 2. OrcaWave COM/DDE interface
- OrcaWave may expose a COM automation interface similar to OrcaFlex
- Test: `win32com.client` → connect to running OrcaWave instance
- Enumerate available methods; test if view capture is supported

### 3. OrcaFlex Model + GDF workaround
- `OrcFxAPI.Model` has `SaveModelView()` and can load GDF body meshes
- Test: load BMC.gdf into OrcaFlex Model → `SaveModelView()` for
  elevation, plan, perspective views → embed resulting images in HTML
- Risk: OrcaFlex model will not have the free-surface zone geometry

### 4. Headless rendering (Pyvista / PyOpenGL)
- If no GUI API exists, evaluate Pyvista for offscreen rendering of GDF/FDF
- Does not require a running OrcaWave/OrcaFlex process

### 5. Subprocess + screenshot automation
- Launch OrcaWave with model file as argument (check command-line API)
- Use `mss` / `pyautogui` to capture the OrcaWave window after it renders
- Fragile but may be the only option if no programmatic API exists

## Output / Deliverables

- Documented findings in `orcaflex-visualization` skill (v1.2.0 bump)
- If any approach works: `save_orcawave_views(owd_path, out_dir)` helper
  added to digitalmodel (new `mesh_capture.py` or extend `benchmark_plotter.py`)
- Images: elevation (front XZ), plan (top XY), perspective (isometric)
- Integration: `build_mesh_schematic_html()` — static images placed ABOVE
  or ALONGSIDE existing Plotly Mesh3d (complementary, not replacing it)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Approaches 1–5 investigated; findings documented in skill (v1.2.0)
- [ ] At least one working approach demonstrated with actual screenshots
- [ ] Screenshot helper committed to digitalmodel
- [ ] `build_mesh_schematic_html()` updated to embed static images when available
- [ ] Static images match the 3-view layout of Figure 30 in the WAMIT guide
