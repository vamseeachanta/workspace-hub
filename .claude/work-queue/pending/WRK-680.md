# governance(review): strengthen archive gate validation

## Problem

WRK-624 requires archive to verify merge/sync and queue state, but current orchestrator evidence stops once close completes. Without archive-level validation, items could slip into `done` without completing sync or follow-up workflows.

## What

Add an archive gate validator that runs after closing to confirm merge/sync state, capture `archive-evidence.yaml`, and ensure the `done` item meets queue validation rules before moving to `archived`. Document the average time/delta for lineage restoration and record it in the orchestrator comparison timeline.

## Plan

- Phase 1 — Archive checklist: define the required evidence (merge/sync completed, queue validates, follow-up references archived).
- Phase 2 — Validator integration: extend `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py` or a new helper to skip archive unless the evidence exists; store the results in `archive-evidence.yaml`.
- Phase 3 — Timeline update: log the archive validation result in `assets/WRK-656/orchestrator-timeline.md` so reruns show completion beyond close.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Archive evidence includes merge/sync proof and queue validation status.
- [ ] Validator blocks archive if the evidence is missing or flagged.
- [ ] Timeline artifact notes archive validation timestamps for each orchestrator run.
- [ ] Comparison HTML mentions the archive gate status and links to the new evidence file.

## Outcome

The orchestrator lifecycle will earn an archive-level seal, ensuring WRK-624’s full gate set is enforced through finish.
