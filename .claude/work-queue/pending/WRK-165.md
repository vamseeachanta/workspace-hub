# Research Subsea Intervention Analysis Opportunities

## What

Research and map the subsea intervention market to identify where A&CE's existing engineering capabilities (OrcaFlex modeling, riser analysis, marine operations, data analytics) can address real demand. Currently there is active market demand for subsea intervention analysis.

## Why

- Active market demand exists now — intervention vessel day rates are high and operators need analysis to de-risk operations
- A&CE already has adjacent capabilities: OrcaFlex installation analysis, drilling/completion riser modeling (WRK-046), riser component data (WRK-105), rig fleet inventory, HSE risk scoring
- Subsea intervention connects well planning (WRK-163/164) to marine operations — the full lifecycle from well to seabed
- BSEE intervention activity data already collected (WRK-016) — can be used for market sizing and trend analysis

## Research Scope

### Market Questions
- [ ] What subsea intervention analysis services are currently in demand? (light well intervention, heavy intervention, coiled tubing, wireline, ROV-based)
- [ ] Who are the buyers? (operators, intervention vessel contractors, SURF contractors)
- [ ] What analysis deliverables do they need? (operability studies, riser analysis, vessel motion limits, tool deployment analysis, metocean windows)
- [ ] What software/tools are used? (OrcaFlex, Flexcom, DeepRiser, bespoke)
- [ ] What are the typical project values and timelines?
- [ ] Who are the current competitors providing these services?

### Technical Questions
- [ ] What OrcaFlex model types are needed for intervention analysis? (intervention riser, coiled tubing, wireline, tool deployment)
- [ ] What are the critical design parameters? (vessel motion, riser stroke, tool weight, current profiles, heave compensation)
- [ ] What gaps exist in our current OrcaFlex model library for intervention scenarios?
- [ ] Can WRK-046 (drilling/completion riser) be extended to intervention risers?
- [ ] What intervention-specific data would enrich worldenergydata? (vessel capabilities, tool strings, intervention history by field)

### Data Available
- BSEE completion and intervention activity data (WRK-016, archived)
- Rig fleet and construction vessel inventories (WRK-103, WRK-104/135)
- Drilling riser component data (WRK-105)
- HSE incident data for intervention operations (WRK-014)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Market landscape document: who buys, what they need, what it pays
- [ ] Technical gap analysis: what we can do now vs. what we need to build
- [ ] Competitor scan: 5-10 firms providing subsea intervention analysis
- [ ] Recommended service offerings with effort-to-launch estimates
- [ ] Connection to GTM strategy (WRK-148) with specific target companies that need intervention analysis
