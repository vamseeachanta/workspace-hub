# Install Tailscale VPN on ace-linux-2

## What

Install and configure Tailscale on ace-linux-2 to match ace-linux-1's remote access
capability. Both machines should be reachable via Tailscale IPs from any network.

## Why

- ace-linux-1 already has Tailscale (100.107.64.76/32) — ace-linux-2 does not
- Without Tailscale, ace-linux-2 is only reachable on the local LAN (192.168.1.103)
- Remote work, phone SSH, and cross-network access all require VPN
- Parity between the two Linux workstations — either should be usable remotely

## Steps

1. Install Tailscale: `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh`
2. Start and authenticate: `sudo tailscale up`
3. Verify: `tailscale status` — confirm assigned IP
4. Test from ace-linux-1: `ping <ace-linux-2-tailscale-ip>`
5. Update aceengineer-02.md network table with Tailscale interface
6. Update workstations SKILL.md with Tailscale IP

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tailscale installed and running on ace-linux-2
- [ ] ace-linux-2 visible in Tailscale admin console
- [ ] ace-linux-1 can reach ace-linux-2 via Tailscale IP
- [ ] aceengineer-02.md updated with Tailscale network info
