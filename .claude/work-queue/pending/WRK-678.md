# test(review): automate close gate follow-up capture

## Problem

WRK-624 requires that future-work synthesis create documented follow-ups before an item closes, but the current orchestrator evidence relies on manual notes. Without automation, close gate reviewers cannot verify that follow-ups were captured or prioritized before hitting `done`.

## What

Automate the close gate by generating `future-work-recommendations.md` from a template that collects action items, follow-up WRK ids, and team decisions, then ensure the close script verifies those follow-ups before archival. The orchestrator summary should hyperlink to the follow-up artifact so gate compliance is immediately visible.

## Plan

- Phase 1 — Template: build a future-work capture template that prompts for follow-up WRKs, dependencies, and rationale.
- Phase 2 — Close script integration: have the close script fail when the follow-up artifact is missing or lists no suggested WRKs; enforce the artifact is present before marking the gate pass.
- Phase 3 — Summary link: update `assets/WRK-656/wrk-656-orchestrator-comparison.html` and per-agent summaries to link to the follow-up artifact (and optionally the created WRK IDs).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `future-work-recommendations.md` exists for each orchestrator run.
- [ ] Close script validates the follow-up artifact before moving the item to `done`.
- [ ] Comparison HTML links to the follow-up artifact and notes the generated WRK IDs.
- [ ] Follow-up WRKs exist or are drafted from the captured items when required.

## Outcome

Closing an orchestrator run will always produce a structured recommendation set so reviewers can validate that learning loop before archiving.
