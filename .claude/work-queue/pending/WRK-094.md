# Plan, reassess, and improve the workspace-hub workflow

## What
Conduct a comprehensive review of the current workspace-hub workflow — including the work queue system, skill execution pipeline, orchestrator pattern, reflect cycle, and daily productivity loop. Identify bottlenecks, redundancies, and gaps. Propose and implement improvements.

## Why
The workspace has grown organically with 90+ work items captured, but only 16 processed. The state.yaml is out of sync (last_id: 85 vs actual highest WRK-093). The workflow needs a holistic reassessment to improve throughput, reduce friction, and ensure the tools actually accelerate work rather than adding overhead.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit current workflow: capture → triage → process → archive pipeline
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks (e.g., 20 pending items, low process rate)
- [ ] Review state.yaml sync issues and fix counter drift
- [ ] Assess skill effectiveness (which skills are used, which are dead weight)
- [ ] Evaluate orchestrator pattern adherence in practice
- [ ] Propose concrete improvements with effort/impact assessment
- [ ] Implement quick wins immediately
- [ ] Document revised workflow in specs/

## Plan

**Spec**: `specs/modules/wrk-094-workflow-improvement.md`
**Target**: workspace-hub `.claude/` infrastructure

### Current State (from research)
- **Queue**: 107 items, 63 pending, 1 working, 40 archived (31% processed)
- **State drift**: `state.yaml` last_id=106 (actual=107), last_processed=WRK-011 (WRK-098 is latest)
- **Automation**: Zero cron jobs; all processing is manual `/work run` invocation
- **Skills**: 21 coordination skills; ~15 are low/zero value (zombie skills)
- **Reflect cycle**: Stuck — abstract/generalize/store phases never complete
- **Plan coverage**: ~13% of items have plans (should be 100% before processing)

### Phase 1 — Quick Wins (immediate)
1. **Fix state.yaml counters**: Resync last_id, last_processed, total_processed, total_archived
2. **Cull zombie skills**: Produce explicit keep/archive list for all 20 skills in `coordination/workspace/`. Criteria: used in last 30 days, or referenced by active WRK items. Archive to `_archive/`.
   - **Audit step**: Check dependent workflows before archiving any skill
3. **Add plan gate enforcement**: Modify `generate-index.py` to flag items without `## Plan` section; add pre-flight check in process.md

### Phase 2 — Automated Orchestration
4. **Investigate automated batch processing feasibility**: Document: (a) Can Claude Code run non-interactively via cron? (b) What error handling is needed for failed runs? (c) Machine must be always-on. (d) Alternative: manual batch script triggered by user on demand.
5. **Fix reflect RAGS cycle**: Debug abstract/generalize/store phase failures in `daily-reflect.sh`; add logging
6. **Batch INDEX regeneration**: Call `generate-index.py` once per batch session instead of per archive operation

### Phase 3 — Process Improvements
7. **Skill lifecycle governance**: Establish 3 tiers:
   - Tier 1 (Core): work-queue, claude-reflect, repo-readiness, skill-learner
   - Tier 2 (Value-add): knowledge-manager, repo-sync
   - Tier 3 (Experimental): archive or delete
8. ~~**Brochure sync automation**~~: Removed — file as separate WRK item (scope creep from core workflow improvement)
9. **Orchestrator ↔ work-queue integration**: After reflect cycle, if patterns found, auto-trigger batch processing

### Phase 4 — Documentation
10. **Revised workflow doc**: `specs/modules/workspace-workflow-v2.md`
11. **Skill catalog cleanup**: Update `skills-catalog.json` to remove archived skills
12. **Metrics dashboard**: Add throughput, plan coverage, skill usage metrics to INDEX.md

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Queue throughput | 31% | 80% (mechanism: batch-process all simple Route A items with plans; ~20 items in 2-3 sessions) |
| Plan coverage | 13% | 100% |
| Active skills | 21 (15 zombie) | 10-12 core |
| Automated processing | 0 | Feasibility assessed; manual batch script if cron not viable |
| Reflect cycle completion | 1/4 phases | 4/4 phases |

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MAJOR | Gemini: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - Phase 1: Replaced vague "archive 10-15 skills" with explicit keep/archive list requirement for all 20 skills, with dependency audit
  - Phase 2: Replaced "cron job" with feasibility investigation — Claude Code is interactive CLI, non-interactive cron is non-trivial
  - Phase 3: Removed brochure sync automation (scope creep) — should be separate WRK item
  - Added concrete throughput mechanism: batch-process simple Route A items with plans
  - Updated automated processing target from "1 daily cron" to feasibility-gated
  - Codex additionally requested state.yaml update script with validation checks, and concrete reflect cycle debug steps
