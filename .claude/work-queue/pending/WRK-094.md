# Plan, reassess, and improve the workspace-hub workflow

## What
Conduct a comprehensive review of the current workspace-hub workflow — including the work queue system, skill execution pipeline, orchestrator pattern, reflect cycle, and daily productivity loop. Identify bottlenecks, redundancies, and gaps. Propose and implement improvements.

## Why
The workspace has grown organically with 90+ work items captured, but only 16 processed. The state.yaml is out of sync (last_id: 85 vs actual highest WRK-093). The workflow needs a holistic reassessment to improve throughput, reduce friction, and ensure the tools actually accelerate work rather than adding overhead.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit current workflow: capture → triage → process → archive pipeline
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks (e.g., 20 pending items, low process rate)
- [ ] Review state.yaml sync issues and fix counter drift
- [ ] Assess skill effectiveness (which skills are used, which are dead weight)
- [ ] Evaluate orchestrator pattern adherence in practice
- [ ] Propose concrete improvements with effort/impact assessment
- [ ] Implement quick wins immediately
- [ ] Document revised workflow in specs/
