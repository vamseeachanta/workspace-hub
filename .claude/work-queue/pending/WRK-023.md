# Property GIS development timeline — historical and future projection with animation

## What
For a given property, build a GIS-based timeline showing how the surrounding area has developed over time and project how future development may evolve. Leverage historical satellite imagery (Google Earth historical imagery, Landsat, Sentinel), permit/zoning data, and development patterns to create:
1. **Historical timeline**: visual progression of development around the property over years/decades
2. **Future projection**: anticipated development based on zoning plans, permit filings, growth patterns
3. **Animation**: Google Earth-style animated flythrough or timelapse showing development progression

## Why
Understanding how an area has developed — and where it's heading — is critical for property investment decisions. A visual GIS timeline makes development patterns immediately apparent and supports investment thesis with spatial evidence rather than just market comparables.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Historical satellite/aerial imagery retrieval for a property location across multiple time periods
- [ ] Development change detection: identify new construction, road expansion, land use changes
- [ ] Permit and zoning data integration where available (local government open data)
- [ ] Timeline visualization: side-by-side or slider comparison of historical imagery
- [ ] Future development projection based on:
  - Current zoning and planned zoning changes
  - Filed permits and approved developments
  - Growth trajectory extrapolation from historical patterns
- [ ] Google Earth animation / KML timelapse export
- [ ] Blender 3D visualization option for development progression
- [ ] Report output with timeline narrative and key development milestones
- [ ] Document data sources, projection methodology, and confidence levels
