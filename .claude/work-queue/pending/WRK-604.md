# doc-index: Remap Legacy HDD Records

## What

Two legacy HDD backup directories are excluded from Phase E2 remap and sit at
`domain=other, target_repos=[]`:

| Path | Records |
|------|---------|
| `/mnt/ace/data/va-hdd-2/` | ~13,810 |
| `/mnt/ace/data/2021-11-22-sd-HDD/` | ~11,266 |

Total: ~25,076 records. These are hard-drive backups from an earlier era, likely
a mix of engineering files, personal files, and OS clutter.

## Why

Low priority — these are backups, not primary sources. But classifying the
engineering subset improves overall index quality and makes them discoverable
via `query-docs.sh`.

## Steps

1. Inspect top-level structure of both directories:
   ```bash
   ls /mnt/ace/data/va-hdd-2/ | sort | head -30
   ls /mnt/ace/data/2021-11-22-sd-HDD/ | sort | head -30
   ```
2. Identify engineering sub-folders (e.g. `Engineering/`, `OrcaFlex/`, `Standards/`)
   vs. personal/OS clutter (`Windows/`, `Users/Documents/`, `Downloads/`)
3. Add personal/OS paths to `SKIP_PATH_FRAGMENTS` in `phase-e2-remap.py`
4. Add path rules for identifiable engineering sub-folders
5. Remove `"2021-11-22-sd-HDD"` and `"va-hdd-2"` from `SKIP_PATH_FRAGMENTS`
   only after adding per-sub-folder rules
6. Re-run remap (dry-run first), verify, commit

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Both HDD top-level structures documented in WRK body
- [ ] Personal/OS clutter paths added to SKIP_PATH_FRAGMENTS
- [ ] Engineering sub-folders (if any) classified with appropriate domain+repos
- [ ] `"2021-11-22-sd-HDD"` and `"va-hdd-2"` SKIP entries removed (or narrowed)
- [ ] Commit message references WRK-604

## Notes

- Both paths are local to ace-linux-1 at `/mnt/ace/data/`
- Expectation: majority is personal/OS — most will stay as SKIP; only engineering
  sub-folders get classified
- If drives are physically unavailable (unmounted), defer until drives are reconnected
