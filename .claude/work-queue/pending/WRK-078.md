# Create energy data case study — BSEE field economics with NPV/IRR workflow

## What
Write a case study for the website showing a BSEE field economics analysis using the NPV/IRR workflow with real (anonymized) data. Follow the existing case study HTML pattern established by the 4 engineering case studies.

## Why
The website has 4 engineering case studies but zero energy data case studies. This is a major sales gap — prospects in the energy data vertical have no proof points to evaluate.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Case study HTML page in case-studies/ directory
- [ ] Follows existing case study HTML/CSS pattern
- [ ] Shows real BSEE production data analysis workflow
- [ ] Includes NPV/IRR calculation results
- [ ] Metrics section with quantified results (time savings, accuracy)
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data
- [ ] Linked from energy.html and case-studies/index.html
