# fix(work-queue): restore /work skill compatibility in Codex CLI

## Problem

`/work` skill invocation is inconsistent in Codex CLI compared with Claude and Gemini. This blocks reliable Codex participation in work-queue flows.

## What

Identify why slash-command skill loading fails in Codex CLI and implement a supported workaround (or direct wrapper path) so `/work add`, `/work list`, and `/work run` equivalents are available in Codex sessions.

## Why

Codex is used as a review/orchestration provider in the work-queue contract. If `/work` cannot be invoked reliably, queue operations become error-prone and cross-review gates degrade.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Root cause documented for Codex `/work` behavior.
- [ ] Stable Codex-compatible invocation path implemented.
- [ ] `/work add` and `/work list` (or explicit equivalents) validated in Codex CLI.
- [ ] Any Codex-specific notes added to adapter docs.
- [ ] Regression evidence captured on ace-linux-2.
