## Problem

Cron jobs are not consistently deployed across all workstations. Current state
as of 2026-02-23:

| Machine | session-analysis | model-ids | skills-curation | **comprehensive-learning** |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| ace-linux-1 | ✓ 3AM daily | ✓ Sun 3:30AM | ✓ Mon 4AM | ❌ MISSING |
| ace-linux-2 | ❌ NO CRONTAB | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| acma-ansys05 | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown |
| acma-ws014 | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown |

The comprehensive-learning nightly pipeline (v2.1.0) is fully built and tested
but has never been scheduled even on ace-linux-1, the designated host.

## Fix

### ace-linux-1 (add comprehensive-learning)
```bash
# Add to crontab (run at 2AM daily, before session-analysis at 3AM)
0 2 * * * bash /mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/scripts/cron/comprehensive-learning-nightly.sh >> /tmp/comprehensive-learning.log 2>&1
```

### ace-linux-2 (full cron setup)
SSH in and establish complete crontab matching ace-linux-1 schedule.
Path: `/mnt/workspace-hub` (different from ace-linux-1).

### Office machines (acma-ansys05, acma-ws014)
Audit what is running; deploy session-analysis and model-ids as minimum.
comprehensive-learning runs only on ace-linux-1 (single-machine guard in SKILL.md).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ace-linux-1: comprehensive-learning cron added (2AM daily)
- [ ] ace-linux-1: `crontab -l` verified — all 4 jobs present
- [ ] ace-linux-2: full crontab deployed (session-analysis, model-ids, skills-curation)
- [ ] ace-linux-2: comprehensive-learning NOT added (ace-linux-1 is designated host)
- [ ] Office machines: cron audit completed; gaps documented or filled
- [ ] `/tmp/comprehensive-learning.log` shows successful run within 24h of scheduling
- [ ] Cron schedule documented in `.claude/docs/new-machine-setup.md` (WRK-313)

- WRK-313: new-machine setup guide (blocks this — doc should reference cron schedule)
- WRK-308: lean pre-commit — skills-curation and readiness moved to nightly cron
- WRK-304: Stop hook cleanup — comprehensive-learning is the target consumer
