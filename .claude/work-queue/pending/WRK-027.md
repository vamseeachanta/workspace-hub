# AQWA Batch Analysis Execution

## What
Enable batch execution of multiple AQWA runs. Support running parametric sweeps, multiple wave headings, or multiple hull configurations in a single batch command with job queuing and parallel execution where possible.

## Why
Diffraction analysis often requires hundreds of runs across wave periods, headings, and loading conditions. Batch execution automates this, tracks progress, and handles failures gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Batch job definition (list of runs with parameters)
- [ ] Sequential and parallel execution modes
- [ ] Progress tracking and status reporting
- [ ] Failure handling with retry logic
- [ ] Results collection and organization per batch
- [ ] Integration with AQWA runner (WRK-025)
