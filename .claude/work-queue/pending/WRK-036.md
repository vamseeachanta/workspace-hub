# OrcaFlex structure deployment analysis - supply boat side deployment with structural loads

## What
OrcaFlex analysis of structure deployment from a supply boat (side of vessel). Model the deployment through the splash zone to capture loads, then provide those loads for downstream structural integrity assessment.

## Context
- **Deployment method**: Equipment deployed from supply boat side
- **Analysis focus**: Splash zone transit — the critical phase where wave loads, snap loads, and dynamic amplification are highest
- **Parametric variables**:
  - Varying structure lengths
  - Accurate weight vs. envelope weights
  - Seastate conditions and vessel RAOs
- **Deliverable**: Load sets (tensions, shears, moments) suitable for structural analysis

## Why
Structural deployment through the splash zone is a critical lift operation. OrcaFlex time-domain analysis captures the dynamic loads (wave-induced, snap, slam) that static calculations miss. These loads feed into structural FEA to verify the equipment and rigging integrity under installation conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OrcaFlex model of structure deployed from supply boat side
- [ ] Splash zone analysis capturing dynamic loads during lowering
- [ ] Parametric runs: varying lengths, weight cases (accurate and envelope)
- [ ] Seastate sensitivity with vessel RAOs applied
- [ ] Load extraction (tensions, shears, bending moments) at critical locations
- [ ] Loads formatted/exported for structural analysis input
- [ ] Results summary with governing load cases identified
- [ ] Documentation of model assumptions, parameters, and load output format

*Source: orcaflex analysis of structure deployment analysis. deploy equipment using supply boat on side of the vessel. perform analysis to ensure loads are captured. Finally structural integrity needs to be determined. method: splash zone; varying lengths; accurate weight or envelope weights; seastate RAOs etc. provide loads for structural analysis*
