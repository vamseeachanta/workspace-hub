# Stock analysis — trend changes, technical indicators, insider trading benchmarks

## What
Build a stock analysis capability that monitors and identifies drastic changes in stock trends, evaluates key technical indicators, and tracks insider trading activity against benchmarks. The system should surface notable events such as unusual volume spikes, trend reversals, indicator crossovers, and significant insider buy/sell activity.

## Why
Timely awareness of drastic shifts in stock behavior — whether from price action, technical signal divergence, or insider trading patterns — enables faster, more informed investment decisions. Automating this monitoring reduces the risk of missing significant events.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify and integrate stock price data sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.)
- [ ] Implement trend detection: moving averages, trend line breaks, support/resistance violations
- [ ] Implement technical indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, volume analysis, momentum
- [ ] Define "drastic change" thresholds for alerts (configurable)
- [ ] Integrate insider trading data (SEC Form 4 filings / EDGAR)
- [ ] Establish insider trading benchmarks (normal vs. unusual activity)
- [ ] Alert/notification system for significant events
- [ ] Summary dashboard or report output
- [ ] Support for watchlist of specific tickers
- [ ] Document data sources, indicator calculations, and alert thresholds
