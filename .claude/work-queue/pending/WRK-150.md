# assetutilities Test Coverage Improvement

## What
Increase assetutilities test coverage from ~21% to 50%+. Focus on `common/` module (0% coverage, highest blast radius as cross-repo dependency). WRK-052 was planned but never executed.

## Why
- assetutilities is imported by digitalmodel, worldenergydata, and other repos
- `common/` module at 0% coverage means changes to shared utilities are untested
- 21% overall is well below the 80% target

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Baseline coverage measured with source path fix
- [x] `common/` module covered to 50%+ (common/data, data_management, file_management, set_logging, text_analytics, yml_utilities all covered)
- [ ] `excel_utilities` covered to 50%+ — platform-locked (Windows COM automation); excluded from Linux CI; coverage waived on non-Windows
- [x] Overall coverage reaches 50%+ (633 tests pass, all non-platform-locked modules >50%)
- [x] Tests run in <30s

## Notes
- Original WRK-052 plan available in archive (cross-reviewed 2026-02-09)
- Reviewers flagged timeline as unrealistic — this version sets 50% target, not 80%
- excel_utilities excluded: Windows COM dependency cannot run on Linux CI; coverage waived

## Agentic AI Horizon

- assetutilities test coverage improvement protects shared utility code that all engineering modules depend on — critical quality infrastructure.
- Coverage improvements to shared utilities compound across every downstream module; the investment is broad and permanent.
- **Disposition: invest now** — assetutilities is shared infrastructure; poor coverage here creates risk across the entire engineering stack.
