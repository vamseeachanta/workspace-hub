# Executive summary dashboard for diffraction analysis validation

## What

Restructure the master `validation_summary.html` from a single wide table into a multi-section executive summary with logical groupings: input configuration, geometry/mesh, hydrostatic properties, RAO correlations, and semantic equivalence. Currently the table is 14+ columns wide and will become unreadable as more data is surfaced.

## Why

The validation suite has rich data across benchmark artifacts (JSON reports, solver metadata, YAML configs) but the summary only shows DOF correlations and a semantic column. Hydrostatic checks, mesh quality, added mass/damping matrix correlations, and phase data all exist but aren't surfaced. A sectioned dashboard makes this data accessible without overwhelming the reader.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Summary HTML uses collapsible/tabbed sections instead of one wide table
- [ ] Section 1 — Overview: case list, status badges, verdict (existing)
- [ ] Section 2 — Input Config: semantic equivalence, significant diffs expandable
- [ ] Section 3 — Geometry/Mesh: panel counts, mesh source, mesh quality if available
- [ ] Section 4 — Hydrostatic: CoG, stiffness matrix summary (requires solver_metadata export to JSON)
- [ ] Section 5 — RAO Agreement: DOF correlations (magnitude + phase), added mass & damping diagonal correlations
- [ ] Data sourced from `benchmark_report.json` and solver metadata — no manual notes
- [ ] Tooltip or expandable rows for per-case detail (replace horizontal column sprawl)
- [ ] Backward compatible: `--summary-only` still works, same output path

## Notes

- WRK-149 covers the data availability analysis (what's in JSON vs what needs pipeline changes)
- Hydrostatic data is in `solver_metadata.py` extraction but NOT yet exported to `benchmark_report.json` — that's a prerequisite
- Consider Plotly or pure HTML/CSS tabs for the sectioned layout (no JS framework dependencies)
- Current file: `scripts/benchmark/validate_owd_vs_spec.py` → `_generate_master_html()`
