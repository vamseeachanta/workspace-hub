# assetutilities Test Coverage Improvement

## What
Increase assetutilities test coverage from ~21% to 50%+. Focus on `common/` module (0% coverage, highest blast radius as cross-repo dependency). WRK-052 was planned but never executed.

## Why
- assetutilities is imported by digitalmodel, worldenergydata, and other repos
- `common/` module at 0% coverage means changes to shared utilities are untested
- 21% overall is well below the 80% target

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Baseline coverage measured with source path fix
- [ ] `common/` module covered to 50%+
- [ ] `excel_utilities` covered to 50%+
- [ ] Overall coverage reaches 50%+
- [ ] Tests run in <30s

## Notes
- Original WRK-052 plan available in archive (cross-reviewed 2026-02-09)
- Reviewers flagged timeline as unrealistic — this version sets 50% target, not 80%

## Agentic AI Horizon

- assetutilities test coverage improvement protects shared utility code that all engineering modules depend on — critical quality infrastructure.
- Coverage improvements to shared utilities compound across every downstream module; the investment is broad and permanent.
- **Disposition: invest now** — assetutilities is shared infrastructure; poor coverage here creates risk across the entire engineering stack.
