# OrcaFlex drilling and completion riser parametric analysis

## What
Develop detailed OrcaFlex analysis capability for drilling and completion risers with parametric analysis across key design variables (water depth, vessel offset, current profiles, riser properties, tensioner settings, etc.).

## Why
Drilling and completion risers operate under complex combined loading (vessel motions, wave, current, mud weight, pressure). Parametric analysis enables rapid assessment of riser operability, identification of governing conditions, and design optimisation across project variables.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OrcaFlex model setup for drilling riser system (marine riser, tensioner, BOP, LMRP)
- [ ] OrcaFlex model setup for completion riser system
- [ ] Parametric variables: water depth, vessel offset, current profiles, wave conditions
- [ ] Parametric variables: riser properties (OD, WT, grade), mud weight, top tension
- [ ] Dynamic analysis: stress, fatigue, flex joint angles, tensioner stroke
- [ ] Operability assessment: limiting seastates, maximum offsets
- [ ] Results extraction at critical locations (flex joints, stress joints, connectors)
- [ ] Summary output: utilisation tables, operability envelopes
- [ ] Tests validating model setup and parametric execution
- [ ] Documentation of riser configurations and analysis methodology
