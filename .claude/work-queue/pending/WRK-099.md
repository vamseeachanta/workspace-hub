# Run 3-Way Benchmark on Unit Box Hull

## What
Execute the full 3-way benchmark comparison (AQWA, OrcaWave, BEMRosetta) using the Unit Box hull as a validation case.

## Why
The Unit Box is the simplest geometry, analytically tractable, and fastest to run. Good for validating that all solver setups are correct before running more complex hulls.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 3 solvers complete successfully
- [ ] Results converted to unified DiffractionResults format
- [ ] Benchmark comparison run via `BenchmarkRunner`
- [ ] Consensus level: expect FULL or MAJORITY (simple geometry)
- [ ] Output: JSON report, HTML report, overlay plots
- [ ] Document any solver-specific quirks encountered
