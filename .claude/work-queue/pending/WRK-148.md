# ACE-GTM: A&CE Go-to-Market Strategy Stream

## What
Parent work item for all A&CE go-to-market activity. This is a **running stream** — new findings, recommendations, and action items get added here as the strategy evolves. Child items get spun off for execution.

## Why
Revenue is oxygen. The engineering substance is strong but the packaging, positioning, and pipeline don't exist yet. This stream coordinates all work to fix that.

## Strategic Context
- **Positioning**: "AI-native engineering insights & analytics for offshore energy" (FIRM, not person)
- **Sequence**: Firm positioning → win 3-5 clients → build personal brand behind the firm
- **Revenue target**: 3-5 retainers at $120K = $360-600K
- **ICP**: Mid-market offshore engineering firms (10-50 engineers)

## Child Work Items (ACE-GTM group)

| WRK | Title | Priority | Status |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| WRK-142 | Work review + Anthropic outreach draft | high (deadline Feb 17) | **DONE** (archived 02-16, Dario messaged on LinkedIn) |
| WRK-146 | Website positioning overhaul | high | pending |
| WRK-147 | Private business strategy repo setup | high | pending |

## Findings & Recommendations Log

_Add new findings here as they emerge. Spin off as child WRK items when actionable._

### Feb 19: O&G Venture Groups as a GTM Channel
- **Note**: Oil and gas venture/corporate venture groups actively scout for innovative engineering work
- Examples: Chevron Technology Ventures, Shell Ventures, BP Ventures, Equinor Ventures, TotalEnergies Ventures
- These groups fund and partner with startups solving real O&G engineering problems — A&CE's AI-native engineering tools squarely fit this mandate
- **Action to explore**: Identify and track corporate venture scouts at Tier 4 target companies (Shell, Chevron, BP) + NOC venture arms; a partnership/investment conversation may open faster than a services contract

### Feb 18: YC Application
- **Apply**: https://www.ycombinator.com/apply
- YC S26/W27 batch — accelerator path for A&CE; worth tracking deadline and assessing fit

### Feb 16: GTM Strategy Document (Complete Playbook)
- **Asset (raw)**: `.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-148/ace-gtm-strategy-2026-02-16.pdf`
- **Asset (styled)**: `.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-148/ace-gtm-strategy-styled-2026-02-16.pdf` — presentation-ready with branded sections, color-coded fit scores, priority action matrix
- **Contents**: 6 sections — Target Company List, Pitch (3 versions), Outreach Templates, Anthropic Outreach, Conferences & Visibility, Priority Action Matrix
- **20 target companies** across 5 tiers:
  - **Tier 1 — Offshore Engineering Consultancies** (highest fit): Subsea7 (5/5), Wood plc (5/5), Worley (5/5), TechnipFMC (4/5), 2H Offshore (5/5), McDermott (4/5), Saipem (3/5)
  - **Tier 2 — Classification & Software**: DNV Digital Solutions (5/5), ABS (4/5), Bureau Veritas (3/5), Akselos (5/5), Cognite (4/5)
  - **Tier 3 — Offshore Wind**: Orsted (4/5), Equinor (4/5), Dominion CVOW (3/5)
  - **Tier 4 — Oil Majors** (acqui-hire): Shell (3/5), Chevron (3/5), BP (3/5)
  - **Tier 5 — Specialist Niche** (high probability): Oceaneering (4/5), Intecsea/Worley (4/5)
- **3 pitch versions**: 30-sec elevator, 2-min email, 1-page executive summary
- **Outreach templates**: LinkedIn connection (3 variants: VP Eng, Digital Leader, M&A), follow-up, cold email (VP Eng, M&A/Corp Dev)
- **Anthropic outreach**: Alex Albert (X tweet + DM), Boris Cherny (LinkedIn), Irina Ghose (LinkedIn)
- **Conferences & Visibility** (Section 5):
  - **OTC Houston 2026** (May 4-7) — register NOW, plan meetings with Subsea7/Wood/Worley/TechnipFMC/ABS/Oceaneering
  - **ISOPE 2026** (May 31–Jun 5, Orlando) — CFP OPEN, submit abstract on AI agent orchestration or ML fatigue
  - **OMAE 2026** (Jun 7-12, Tokyo) — check late submissions, DNV/classification society audience
  - **WindEurope 2026** (Apr 21-23) — for Tier 3 targets (Orsted, Equinor, Siemens Gamesa)
  - **Quick win**: LinkedIn content series this week — "How I automated 50 OrcaFlex configs in 4 hours"
- **Priority Action Matrix** (Section 6, 13 actions):
  - HIGH/This week: LinkedIn → Laura Leonard (Worley), Subsea7 hiring manager, submit ISOPE abstract, Thomas Leurent (Akselos)
  - HIGH/This month: Register OTC Houston 2026
  - MEDIUM/This week: Tweet @ Alex Albert, LinkedIn → Boris Cherny
  - MEDIUM/This month: Cold email Patrick Ryan (ABS), 2H Offshore, Oceaneering
  - ONGOING: LinkedIn content series, website refresh (WRK-146)
- **Key insight from Subsea7 entry**: "They're literally hiring for what A&CE already has" — directly validates WRK-151 through WRK-156 (Abaqus + installation engineering gaps)

### Feb 15-16: Initial Strategy Session
- Full session notes: `.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-146/strategy-session-2026-02-15.md`
- 6 website issues identified (generic voice, empty About, templated cases, blog disconnected, no proof, no personality)
- 6 GTM paths ranked by control/probability — "win paying clients NOW" is #1
- Positioning decision: firm > person (Cognite/Akselos model)
- Business strategy repo architecture designed (mirrors engineering orchestration)
- Open-source S-N curve library identified as attention-generating play

## Plan

**Target**: Coordination across WRK-146, WRK-147, and ongoing GTM activity

### Execution Sequence
1. **WRK-147** (strategy repo) — create first, provides home for all GTM artifacts
2. **WRK-146** (website overhaul) — execute second, makes A&CE presentable to prospects
3. **Outbound experiments** — start after website is repositioned
4. **Conference prep** — OTC Houston registration (May 4-7), ISOPE abstract submission

### Coordination Pattern
- This item stays `in_progress` indefinitely (stream item)
- Weekly scorecard updates in aceengineer-strategy repo
- New findings append to ## Findings & Recommendations Log
- Actionable items spin off as child WRK items
- Monthly: full re-assessment of priorities and pipeline

### Success Metrics
- 5+ qualified prospects in pipeline within 60 days
- 1+ outbound experiment launched within 2 weeks
- Website repositioned within 1 week
- Strategy repo operational within 1 day

### Dependencies
- WRK-147 must complete before strategy tracking begins
- WRK-146 must complete before outbound begins

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All child items (WRK-142, 146, 147) completed
- [ ] Website repositioned with firm voice
- [ ] Business strategy repo operational with weekly scorecard habit
- [ ] At least 1 outbound experiment launched
- [ ] Pipeline has 5+ qualified prospects

*This is a stream item — it stays open as long as GTM work is active. Archive only when the strategy stabilizes and pipeline is self-sustaining.*
