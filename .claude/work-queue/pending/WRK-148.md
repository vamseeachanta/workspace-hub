# ACE-GTM: A&CE Go-to-Market Strategy Stream

## What
Parent work item for all A&CE go-to-market activity. This is a **running stream** — new findings, recommendations, and action items get added here as the strategy evolves. Child items get spun off for execution.

## Why
Revenue is oxygen. The engineering substance is strong but the packaging, positioning, and pipeline don't exist yet. This stream coordinates all work to fix that.

## Strategic Context
- **Positioning**: "AI-native engineering insights & analytics for offshore energy" (FIRM, not person)
- **Sequence**: Firm positioning → win 3-5 clients → build personal brand behind the firm
- **Revenue target**: 3-5 retainers at $120K = $360-600K
- **ICP**: Mid-market offshore engineering firms (10-50 engineers)

## Child Work Items (ACE-GTM group)

| WRK | Title | Priority | Status |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| WRK-142 | Work review + Anthropic outreach draft | high (deadline Feb 17) | pending |
| WRK-146 | Website positioning overhaul | high | pending |
| WRK-147 | Private business strategy repo setup | high | pending |

## Findings & Recommendations Log

_Add new findings here as they emerge. Spin off as child WRK items when actionable._

### Feb 15-16: Initial Strategy Session
- Full session notes: `.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-146/strategy-session-2026-02-15.md`
- 6 website issues identified (generic voice, empty About, templated cases, blog disconnected, no proof, no personality)
- 6 GTM paths ranked by control/probability — "win paying clients NOW" is #1
- Positioning decision: firm > person (Cognite/Akselos model)
- Business strategy repo architecture designed (mirrors engineering orchestration)
- Open-source S-N curve library identified as attention-generating play

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All child items (WRK-142, 146, 147) completed
- [ ] Website repositioned with firm voice
- [ ] Business strategy repo operational with weekly scorecard habit
- [ ] At least 1 outbound experiment launched
- [ ] Pipeline has 5+ qualified prospects

*This is a stream item — it stays open as long as GTM work is active. Archive only when the strategy stabilizes and pipeline is self-sustaining.*
