# aceengineer-admin Test Coverage Improvement

## What
Fix the broken build, measure baseline coverage, and improve test coverage to 80%+ for the aceengineer-admin repository. The build is currently broken due to a missing README.md file, and 1154 tests exist but coverage is unknown.

## Why
A broken build prevents any CI/CD operations and blocks all development. Once the build is fixed, the existing 1154 tests need to be validated and coverage gaps filled to ensure code quality.

## Current State
- **Coverage**: Unknown (build broken)
- **Build issue**: Missing README.md causes build failure
- **Test files**: 1154 (existing but unvalidated)
- **Baseline**: Cannot be measured until build is fixed

## Strategy
1. Fix the missing README.md build issue
2. Run existing 1154 tests and verify they pass
3. Measure baseline coverage
4. Identify coverage gaps
5. Write tests to fill gaps and reach 80%+ target

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README.md build issue fixed
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] All 1154 existing tests pass
- [ ] Baseline coverage measured and documented
- [ ] Coverage gaps identified and prioritized
- [ ] Tests written for uncovered code paths
- [ ] Overall repository coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] CI pipeline reports coverage on every PR

## Notes
- Fix the build first -- this unblocks everything else
- The 1154 existing tests may already provide decent coverage once the build is fixed
- Prioritize understanding existing test quality before writing new tests
