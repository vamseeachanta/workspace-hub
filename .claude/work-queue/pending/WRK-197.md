# Nigeria NUPRC + EITI Data Framework

## Rationale

West Africa deepwater is the fourth major offshore basin after GoM, NCS/UKCS, and Brazil:
- **Nigeria**: Bonga (~200k bopd, Shell), Egina (~200k bopd, TotalEnergies), Agbami
  (~250k bopd, Chevron), Bonga North (Shell FID 2025) — all significant deepwater fields
- **Angola**: Agogo, CLOV Phase 3, Begonia, Block 32 (TotalEnergies, BP, Chevron)

Neither country has a clean open data API. But two structured pathways exist:
1. **Nigeria NUPRC**: Monthly blend-level production PDFs (publicly available)
2. **EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative)**: Multi-country reconciliation
   reports covering Nigeria, Angola, Guyana, Suriname, Liberia, Mozambique, Tanzania —
   structured payment/production data with operator-by-operator breakdown, 18–24 month lag

EITI is particularly valuable as a **cross-basin framework**: one parser handles
multiple countries' production data, and it's the only pathway for countries that
lack open data portals (Angola, future Guyana, Suriname).

## Data Sources

### Nigeria NUPRC
- **Portal**: `https://www.nuprc.gov.ng/oil-production-status-report/`
- Monthly crude oil and condensate production by stream/blend (PDF)
- Concession situation reports (operator/block level, PDF) — Jun 2025, Aug 2025 editions
- National Production Monitoring System (NPMS) aggregated data (government-facing)
- Format: PDF tables; requires PDF parsing (pdfplumber / tabula-py)
- Update lag: 4–8 weeks; published monthly

### EITI Reports (multi-country)
- **Portal**: `https://eiti.org/data`
- **EITI Data Explorer API**: `https://data.eiti.org/` — structured JSON API
  with country, year, company, revenue stream filters
- Countries with production data: Nigeria, Angola (limited), Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan,
  Iraq, Mozambique, Tanzania, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Cameroon
- Data types: government revenues, production volumes, company payments
- Update frequency: Annual; lag 18–24 months from reporting year
- Format: JSON API + Excel summary downloads

## Module Structure

```

    nigeria/
      __init__.py
      nuprc_client.py         # PDF downloader + pdfplumber parser
      blend_production.py     # Monthly blend/stream production loader
      field_mapping.py        # Blend name → field/operator mapping table
    eiti/
      __init__.py
      eiti_api.py             # EITI Data Explorer API client (JSON)
      country_production.py   # Multi-country production data via EITI
      payment_data.py         # Government revenue and company payment data
    analysis/
      __init__.py
      field_economics.py      # Nigeria fiscal: PPT + CITA + royalty + NDDC levy
```

## Nigeria Fiscal Regime

| Component | Rate | Notes |
|-----------|------|
-------|
| Petroleum Profits Tax (PPT) | 65.75% (production sharing) / 85% (JV) | On chargeable profits |
| CITA (Companies Income Tax) | 30% | When PPT < CITA (early years) |
| Royalty | 0–10% | Depth-based for deepwater |
| NDDC Levy | 3% | Niger Delta Development Commission |
| Effective government take | ~75–80% | Varies by contract type |

Nigeria uses **Production Sharing Contracts (PSC)** for deepwater (similar to Brazil pre-salt)
with **cost oil recovery** before profit oil split — model this correctly in economics module.

## Key Fields for Case Study Catalog (WRK-191)

| Field | Operator | Water depth | Status |
|-------|----------|-------------|
--------|
| Bonga | Shell (55%) | 1,000m | Producing; Bonga North FID 2025 |
| Egina | TotalEnergies (24%) | 1,500m | Producing since 2019 |
| Agbami | Chevron (67.3%) | 1,440m | Producing since 2008 |
| Preowei | TotalEnergies | 1,000m | Producing |
| Bonga North | Shell | 1,000m | FID 2025, first oil ~2028 |

## Acceptance Criteria

### Nigeria NUPRC
- [ ] PDF downloader for monthly production status reports (NUPRC portal)
- [ ] pdfplumber-based table extractor for blend production tables
- [ ] Blend → field/operator mapping table (manual seed + pattern matching)
- [ ] Monthly blended production loader with caching
- [ ] 15+ tests (PDF parsing, field mapping, production aggregation)

### EITI Framework
- [ ] EITI Data Explorer API client (JSON, country/year/company filters)
- [ ] Country production data loader for Nigeria + Angola + at least 2 other members
- [ ] Annual production aggregation with operator breakdown
- [ ] Cross-validation: compare EITI Nigeria production vs NUPRC PDF totals
- [ ] 15+ tests

### Integration
- [ ] Nigeria fiscal regime modelled (PSC cost oil + profit oil split + PPT/CITA)
- [ ] At least 3 Nigeria deepwater fields added to WRK-191 case study catalog
  (Bonga, Egina, Agbami) with NUPRC production data as source

## Notes

- PDF parsing is fragile; pin pdfplumber version and test against archived PDFs
- NUPRC PDFs use inconsistent table layouts across years — handle gracefully
- EITI API is the more robust pathway; prioritise it over PDF scraping where possible
- Angola: EITI pilot only (not full compliance); production volumes not guaranteed
  in EITI reports — document this clearly in module README
- See DEAD_ENDS.md: Angola ANPG direct API is a dead end; EITI is the only pathway

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Nigeria NUPRC/EITI data framework extends worldenergydata to West Africa — important for global basin coverage and deepwater benchmarking.
- EITI payment data is public but parsing varies by country; data integration skill is needed now; improved models won't change data availability patterns.
- **Disposition: do now** — West Africa deepwater (Nigeria, Angola) is a major frontier basin; adding it alongside Sodir (WRK-018) and UKCS (WRK-193) completes meaningful global coverage.
