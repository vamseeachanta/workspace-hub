# Add Drilling Riser Component Data

## What
Create a drilling riser data module in worldenergydata covering the full riser system component inventory: regular riser joints (dimensions, weight, buoyancy), pup joints, flex/ball joints, telescopic joints, kill/choke lines, BOPs (dimensions, weight, pressure ratings), LMRPs, riser tensioner specs, and associated auxiliary equipment data.

## Why
Drilling riser engineering requires readily accessible component data for system design, analysis input (e.g. OrcaFlex models per WRK-046), weight calculations, and procurement. A structured dataset of standard riser components from major manufacturers enables rapid model setup and parametric studies without manual data entry each time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data schema for riser joints (OD, ID, wall thickness, weight in air/water, buoyancy modules, length, grade)
- [ ] Data schema for BOPs (type, dimensions, weight, pressure rating, bore size)
- [ ] Data schema for LMRPs, flex joints, telescopic joints
- [ ] Data for standard riser sizes (21", 18-3/4", etc.) from public specs
- [ ] BOP stack configurations (surface, subsea) with component breakdown
- [ ] Data loader with query by component type, size, pressure rating
- [ ] Storage format consistent with existing worldenergydata patterns
- [ ] Unit tests for data loading and schema validation
