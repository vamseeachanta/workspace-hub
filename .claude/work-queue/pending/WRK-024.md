# Buckskin field BSEE data analysis

**Nickname:** Buckskin

## What
Perform BSEE data analysis for the Buckskin field, which covers six lease blocks in the Keathley Canyon:
- KC 785
- KC 828
- KC 829
- KC 830
- KC 871
- KC 872

Extract and analyze all available BSEE data for these blocks including production data, wellbore information, drilling/completion activities, and intervention history. Present results under the field nickname "Buckskin."

## Why
Buckskin is a specific field of interest requiring a focused data package. This serves as both a deliverable and a validation case for the broader BSEE field data pipeline (WRK-017).

## BOEM Lease Numbers

| Keathley Canyon Block | BOEM OCS Lease Number | Notes |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| KC 785 | OCS-G 25806 | |
| KC 828 | OCS-G 25813 | |
| KC 829 | OCS-G 25814 | |
| KC 830 | OCS-G 25815 | |
| KC 871 | OCS-G 25823 | BOEM serial register for KC 872 unit references this as KC 871 lease |
| KC 872 | OCS-G 25823 | Same BOEM serial register entry; KC 872 is the designated unit block |

## Key Context

### Field Overview
- Estimated reserves: ~5 billion barrels of oil
- Initial production: 30,000 bopd (June 2019 first oil)
- Development began January 2018; first oil June 2019
- Production achieved with 60% less investment than initial $1.4bn development plan
- Phased development: initially 2 wells tied back to Lucius Spar, now 4 wells onstream with more to come
- Two of the original wells ranked among top ten producing wells in US GoM (2021, 2022)
- Water depth: up to 2,100m

### Operator History
- **Discovery (2009)**: Repsol drilled KC 872 #1 (Buckskin No 1 discovery well) using Stena Drillmax
  - Drilled to 29,404ft; encountered ~400ft net hydrocarbons pay in upper and lower Wilcox formations
- **Appraisal**: Three appraisal wells in KC 785 and KC 829; avg 375ft good quality oil pay in Upper Wilcox
- **Pre-FEED**: Worley/INTECSEA performed pre-FEED work for Repsol (not Chevron — CVX never held working interest at any stage)
- **Current operator**: LLOG Exploration (development and production)
- **Infrastructure**: Subsea tieback to Anadarko-operated (now Oxy) Lucius Spar at KC 875 via 6-mile (10km) tieback
- **2025**: LLOG contracts Buckskin South Expansion — transportation and installation of subsea umbilical and rigid flowline
- **2026**: Harbour Energy to acquire LLOG Exploration from LLOG Holdings LLC

### Database Requirements (from Roy)
- Add Buckskin to database and tables in Part 1 and Part 2
- Verify all lease block data is captured
- Ensure production data reflects phased development timeline

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Query BSEE data for all six Keathley Canyon lease blocks (785, 828, 829, 830, 871, 872)
- [ ] Map BOEM OCS lease numbers (G 25806, G 25813, G 25814, G 25815, G 25823)
- [ ] Add Buckskin to database tables in Part 1 and Part 2
- [ ] Production data summary (oil, gas, water) by block and aggregated for field
- [ ] Validate against known benchmarks: ~30,000 bopd initial, top-10 wells in 2021/2022
- [ ] Wellbore inventory: count, types, status per block (discovery well, 3 appraisal, production wells)
- [ ] Drilling and completion activity timeline (2009 discovery through current)
- [ ] Intervention activity summary
- [ ] Note Buckskin South Expansion (Dec 2025 contract)
- [ ] Results labeled with field nickname "Buckskin"
- [ ] Visualizations: production trends, well count over time, phased development timeline
- [ ] Cross-reference with lower tertiary / Wilcox classification
- [ ] Document operator transitions: Repsol → LLOG → Harbour Energy (2026)
