# feat(workspace-hub): Create Missing Roadshow Skills — engineering-chatbot-demo + maritime-legal

## What

Two new skills identified as gaps during WRK-628 roadshow stream mapping.

### Skill 1: `business/client-demo/engineering-chatbot`

Path: `.claude/skills/business/client-demo/engineering-chatbot/SKILL.md`

Covers the full GTM demo execution workflow for engineering AI chatbot presentations:

**Capabilities:**
- `system_prompt_design` — structured discipline-specific system prompt authoring
  (persona, competencies, codes, tone, disclaimer per WRK-632 fundamentals)
- `demo_script_builder` — 15–20 min demo flow creation: lookups → calculations →
  data processing → document generation
- `calculation_template_builder` — step-by-step engineering calc templates
  (formula → substitution → result → acceptance check format)
- `knowledge_base_structuring` — markdown knowledge files for AI retrieval
  (section headers, tables, numbered clauses for reliable citation)
- `pilot_feedback_capture` — time-savings log, Q&A session recording, ROI metrics
- `chatbot_pitch_delivery` — tier explanation (T1/T2/T3), pricing conversation,
  objection handling

**Trigger:** manual, invoked during demo build or client presentation prep

**Related skills:**
- `ai/prompting/prompt-engineering`
- `data/documents/rag-system-builder`
- `business/communication/teams-api`

**Quick start template (for skill body):**
```markdown
## System Prompt Template
1. Role definition (senior discipline engineer)
2. Core competencies (domain-specific bullet list)
3. Primary codes & standards (with version years)
4. Calculation capabilities (formula notation)
5. ## Persona and Tone (precision · practicality · caution · transparency)
6. ## Known Limitations (hallucination risk, no proprietary data, no software execution)
7. Standard disclaimer
```

### Skill 2: `engineering/maritime-legal`

Path: `.claude/skills/engineering/maritime-legal/SKILL.md`

Covers AI-assisted maritime legal and casualty consulting:

**Capabilities:**
- `casualty_investigation_support` — MAIB/NTSB/USCG report analysis; ISM Code
  non-conformity identification; root-cause taxonomy (equipment/human/weather/SMS)
- `expert_witness_report` — structured technical report for admiralty proceedings;
  Daubert (US) / Civil Evidence Act (UK) compliant framing; standard of care analysis
- `admiralty_law_reference` — COLREGs, Jones Act, Limitation of Liability,
  P&I Club process, Hague-Visby Rules, MLC 2006
- `incident_database_query` — leverage `worldenergydata.MAIBLoader` + `NTSBMarineLoader`
  (WRK-320) for statistical incident context and comparable precedents
- `liability_framing` — translate engineering findings into legal causation language;
  proximate cause, standard of care, damages estimation framework
- `regulatory_framework` — CFR 46/33 (vessel inspection/navigation), SOLAS, MARPOL,
  ISM Code, USCG MISLE reporting requirements, BSEE OCS incident notifications

**Trigger:** manual

**Related skills:**
- `engineering/marine-offshore/marine-safety`
- `data/energy/marine-safety-incidents`
- `engineering/marine-offshore/risk-assessment`
- `business/legal/compliance`

**Note on scope boundary:**
This skill covers the engineering-technical interface with legal proceedings.
It does NOT provide legal advice. All outputs are engineering technical analysis
requiring review by qualified maritime attorneys.

## Why

Both skills are reusable beyond this single client roadshow:
- `engineering-chatbot-demo` is the template for ALL future client roadshows —
  any new discipline requires the same system prompt → knowledge base → demo script flow
- `maritime-legal` opens a specialist consulting service line applicable to
  insurance, P&I clubs, law firms, and ship owners — independent of the current clients

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `.claude/skills/business/client-demo/engineering-chatbot/SKILL.md` created (≤20 lines
  frontmatter, full body with quick-start template, capabilities table, related skills)
- [ ] `.claude/skills/engineering/maritime-legal/SKILL.md` created (≤20 lines frontmatter,
  full body with capabilities, scope boundary disclaimer, related skills)
- [ ] Both skills registered in `.claude/skills/_index.yaml` or equivalent index if it exists
- [ ] Both skills propagated via ecosystem-propagated if applicable
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Agentic AI Horizon

Simple: Codex creates the SKILL.md files following existing patterns in the skill library.
Read 2–3 existing SKILL.md files for format reference before drafting.
Constraint: SKILL.md frontmatter ≤20 lines (agent harness file limit per coding-style rules).
