# GIS skill for cross-application geospatial information and tools

## What
Build a GIS skill/module within digitalmodel that provides geospatial information, coordinate handling, and visualization tools for use across multiple applications and use cases:
- **Applications**: Blender (3D visualization), QGIS (spatial analysis), Google Earth/Maps, and other GIS-capable tools
- **Use cases**: Identifying and plotting well locations, bathymetry/terrain rendering, field boundary mapping, pipeline routes, platform locations
- **Core capabilities**: Coordinate transformation (geographic ↔ projected ↔ local), GIS data import/export, spatial queries, and integration APIs for each target application

Example workflow: given well coordinates from BSEE or other regulatory data, plot them interactively in Blender with proper geospatial positioning, or export to QGIS for spatial analysis overlaid on bathymetry.

## Why
GIS operations are needed across multiple workflows (metocean analysis, field data visualization, digital twin positioning, client presentations). A centralized GIS skill avoids duplicating coordinate handling and spatial logic across separate tools, and provides consistent geospatial capabilities to all downstream applications.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Coordinate reference system (CRS) handling: WGS84, UTM zones, local project coordinates
- [ ] Coordinate transformation utilities between CRS types
- [ ] Well location plotting capability:
  - QGIS: layer generation with well markers, attribute tables
  - Blender: 3D positioned well objects with metadata
- [ ] GIS data format support: GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML/KMZ, GeoTIFF
- [ ] Spatial query support: find wells within radius, bounding box, polygon
- [ ] Bathymetry/terrain data integration for 3D rendering
- [ ] Blender GIS integration: Python scripts/add-on for importing geospatial data
- [ ] QGIS integration: processing scripts or plugin for well data workflows
- [ ] API/interface for other applications to consume GIS data
- [ ] Document supported CRS, data formats, and application integration steps
