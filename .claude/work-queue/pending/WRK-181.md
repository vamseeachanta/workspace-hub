# WRK-181: Session Replay & Time Travel

## What
Record enough session state (tool calls, file diffs, WRK progress) to replay a session from any checkpoint. Enables: (a) debugging agent behavior, (b) "what if" exploration from mid-session, (c) training data for agent improvement.

## SME Discussion Required
- **Platform Architecture**: What granularity of replay? Tool-call level or task level?
- **All**: Privacy implications of recording full session transcripts?
- **AI Operations**: How to use replay data for agent improvement without overfitting?

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Design session state capture format (extend existing JSONL)
- [ ] Phase 2: Implement checkpoint save/restore mechanism
- [ ] Phase 3: Build replay viewer (terminal-based or HTML report)
- [ ] Phase 4: Integrate with git — each checkpoint maps to a commit-like state
