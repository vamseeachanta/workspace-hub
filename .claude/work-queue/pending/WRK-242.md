# Multi-format export as automatic pipeline output stage

## What
Register the multi-format export (Excel, PDF, Parquet) as an automatic final output stage for every analysis pipeline. Agents should call `export_report(result, formats=['xlsx','pdf','parquet'])` as the last step of any analysis. Wire into the BSEE pipeline and fatigue module as first integrations.

## Why
Export capability was validated (WRK-083) but not automated. Agents producing client deliverables need to export in the appropriate format without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `export_report()` function/skill available and registered
- [ ] Wired into BSEE field pipeline (WRK-239) as first integration
- [ ] Wired into fatigue module (WRK-245) as second integration
- [ ] Format selection configurable per analysis type
- [ ] Tested with real analysis outputs for each format

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Every analysis pipeline ultimately requires a client-deliverable export; automating this stage removes a manual step from every workflow
- Export is already built (WRK-083); automation and wiring is the missing work
- **Disposition: invest now** — export is done, automation is the missing step with broad pipeline impact
