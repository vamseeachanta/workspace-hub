# MAIB and NTSB incident correlation with USCG MISLE for root-cause taxonomy

## What

Cross-reference marine casualty databases: MAIB (UK), NTSB (US), and USCG MISLE. Build a
shared incident taxonomy (equipment failure, human factors, weather). Correlation analysis:
incident type vs. vessel type vs. operation phase.

## Why

Marine safety analysis currently requires manual cross-referencing of multiple national
databases with different schemas and classification systems. A unified taxonomy enables
statistical analysis of root causes across jurisdictions, supporting lessons-learned studies
and safety case development for offshore operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] USCG MISLE data integration (where publicly available) — CSV loader with column
      normalisation and year filtering (uscg_client.py)
- [x] Shared incident taxonomy: RootCauseType enum (7 IMO/MAIB categories: human_error,
      equipment_failure, environmental, procedure, design_defect, management, unknown)
      with keyword/regex classifier (incident_taxonomy.py)
- [x] Cross-database entity matching by date window, haversine location proximity,
      and Jaccard vessel-name similarity (incident_correlator.py)
- [x] Correlation analysis output: build_pattern_report (year/vessel_type/root_cause/
      operation_phase/source) and build_correlation_summary DataFrames
- [x] Pytest coverage: 116 tests covering taxonomy, operation phase classifier, normaliser,
      USCG client, correlator, pattern report (with operation_phase), and all utility functions
- [x] MAIB report data parser — MAIBLoader taxonomy pipeline loader (maib_loader.py): CSV
      loading with semicolon delimiter, MAIB_COLUMN_MAP normalisation, year filtering,
      TaxonomyRecord generation, describe_maib_dataset; existing MAIBImporter CSV path retained
- [x] NTSB marine investigation data parser — NTSBMarineLoader CAROL API integration
      (ntsb_marine_loader.py): fetch_marine_accidents(year_start, year_end) with paginated
      CAROL API, NTSB_COLUMN_MAP normalisation, TaxonomyRecord generation, graceful empty-
      DataFrame fallback on API failure; mocked tests only (no live API calls)

## Progress Notes (2026-02-24)

Data ingestion framework complete. All taxonomy classification, column normalisation,
cross-database correlation, and pattern reporting (including operation_phase dimension)
are implemented and tested. Refactored into three focused modules: incident_taxonomy.py,
operation_phase.py, column_maps.py. 116 pytest unit tests passing (static analysis verified).
Live API integration for MAIB and NTSB scraping is the remaining work (pending
network access and API key setup).

## Completion Notes (2026-02-24)

MAIBLoader (maib_loader.py) and NTSBMarineLoader (ntsb_marine_loader.py) added to
the taxonomy pipeline in marine_safety/analysis/incidents/. Both follow the same
design pattern as uscg_client.py. 106 new pytest tests added (45 MAIB, 61 NTSB);
all 736 tests in the targeted suite pass. __init__.py updated to export new classes.
