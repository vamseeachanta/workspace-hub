# MAIB and NTSB incident correlation with USCG MISLE for root-cause taxonomy

## What

Cross-reference marine casualty databases: MAIB (UK), NTSB (US), and USCG MISLE. Build a
shared incident taxonomy (equipment failure, human factors, weather). Correlation analysis:
incident type vs. vessel type vs. operation phase.

## Why

Marine safety analysis currently requires manual cross-referencing of multiple national
databases with different schemas and classification systems. A unified taxonomy enables
statistical analysis of root causes across jurisdictions, supporting lessons-learned studies
and safety case development for offshore operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MAIB report data parser (publicly available investigation reports)
- [ ] NTSB marine investigation data parser
- [ ] USCG MISLE data integration (where publicly available)
- [ ] Shared incident taxonomy: equipment failure, human factors, weather, procedural,
      structural, fire/explosion categories
- [ ] Cross-database entity matching (vessel name, date, location)
- [ ] Correlation analysis output: incident type vs. vessel type vs. operation phase
- [ ] Pytest coverage with sample data from each source
