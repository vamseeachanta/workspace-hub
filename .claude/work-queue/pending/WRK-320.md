## Background

After completing L01–L06 analysis and QA (WRK-317–319), the skills need to be
updated with concrete patterns, parameter tables, and QA lessons learned.

## Scope (targeted updates, not rewrites)

### Skills to Update

1. `orcawave-analysis/SKILL.md`
   - Add full parameter reference table (from WRK-317)
   - Add example-specific run patterns
   - Add Excel output section

2. `orcawave-qtf-analysis/SKILL.md`
   - Add L06 restart workflow
   - Full QTF vs first-order comparison pattern

3. `orcawave-multi-body/SKILL.md`
   - Add L03 concrete patterns (4-body OC4 semi-sub)
   - BodyConnectionParent hierarchy example

4. `orcawave-damping-sweep/SKILL.md`
   - Add L02 drag linearisation pattern (HasWaveSpectrumForDragLinearisation)
   - JONSWAP wave spectrum configuration

### New Files

- `orcawave-analysis/EXAMPLES.md` — concise 1-page example map (L01–L06 at a glance)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Parameter table added to orcawave-analysis skill
- [ ] L06 restart workflow documented in qtf-analysis skill
- [ ] orcawave-multi-body updated with L03 concrete patterns
- [ ] orcawave-damping-sweep updated with L02 drag linearisation
- [ ] EXAMPLES.md created

## Restart Plan

Selected route: Route B

### Route A (Fast Validation)

- Validate existing deliverables against current acceptance criteria
- Capture only deltas and evidence gaps
- Close if all checks pass

### Route B (Full Re-run)

- Re-execute all task steps end-to-end
- Refresh outputs and evidence artifacts
- Reassess acceptance criteria with explicit checklist updates

### Planned Steps (Selected)

1. Status drift detected; re-evaluate acceptance items and close only with evidence.
2. Record evidence paths and command outputs in this WRK entry.
3. Update status and percent_complete only after verification is complete.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Confirm required files/artifacts exist at expected paths
- [ ] Run relevant commands/tests and record results
- [ ] Verify each acceptance criterion with explicit evidence
- [ ] Document residual risks or known gaps
