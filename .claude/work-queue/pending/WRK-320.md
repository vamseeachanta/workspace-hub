## Background

After completing L01–L06 analysis and QA (WRK-317–319), the skills need to be
updated with concrete patterns, parameter tables, and QA lessons learned.

## Scope (targeted updates, not rewrites)

### Skills to Update

1. `orcawave-analysis/SKILL.md`
   - Add full parameter reference table (from WRK-317)
   - Add example-specific run patterns
   - Add Excel output section

2. `orcawave-qtf-analysis/SKILL.md`
   - Add L06 restart workflow
   - Full QTF vs first-order comparison pattern

3. `orcawave-multi-body/SKILL.md`
   - Add L03 concrete patterns (4-body OC4 semi-sub)
   - BodyConnectionParent hierarchy example

4. `orcawave-damping-sweep/SKILL.md`
   - Add L02 drag linearisation pattern (HasWaveSpectrumForDragLinearisation)
   - JONSWAP wave spectrum configuration

### New Files

- `orcawave-analysis/EXAMPLES.md` — concise 1-page example map (L01–L06 at a glance)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Parameter table added to orcawave-analysis skill
- [x] L06 restart workflow documented in qtf-analysis skill
- [x] orcawave-multi-body updated with L03 concrete patterns
- [x] orcawave-damping-sweep updated with L02 drag linearisation
- [x] EXAMPLES.md created

## Restart Plan

Selected route: Route B

### Route A (Fast Validation)

- Validate existing deliverables against current acceptance criteria
- Capture only deltas and evidence gaps
- Close if all checks pass

### Route B (Full Re-run)

- Re-execute all task steps end-to-end
- Refresh outputs and evidence artifacts
- Reassess acceptance criteria with explicit checklist updates

### Planned Steps (Selected)

1. Status drift detected; re-evaluate acceptance items and close only with evidence.
2. Record evidence paths and command outputs in this WRK entry.
3. Update status and percent_complete only after verification is complete.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Confirm required files/artifacts exist at expected paths
- [x] Run relevant commands/tests and record results
- [x] Verify each acceptance criterion with explicit evidence
- [x] Document residual risks or known gaps

## Cross-Review Placeholder

| Reviewer | Verdict (APPROVE|MINOR|MAJOR) | Notes | Date |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------|------|
| Codex | MINOR | Evidence captured; residual gaps tracked in execution update. | 2026-02-26 |
| Gemini | PENDING | | |
| Resolution | PENDING | MAJOR issues resolved before completion | |

## Execution Update (2026-02-26)

Evidence: skill files contain parameter tables, L06 restart workflow, multibody L03 pattern, and damping/JONSWAP pattern plus EXAMPLES.md.
