# chore(docs): Audit + Triage Python Analysis Scripts in Project Archive

## What

Audit all Python scripts found in the document index (ace: ~1,555; dde: ~1,572)
to identify those directly portable into engineering repos after legal scanning.
Produce a triage YAML `specs/data-sources/script-audit.yaml`.

## Known High-Value Script Categories

### 1. OrcaFlex Automation Scripts (directly usable)
Located in: `/mnt/ace/docs/disciplines/drilling/projects/*/Analysis/Python/OrcaFlex*/`
- `DrillingRiserModel.py` — full OrcaFlex drilling riser model builder (geometry,
  line types, boundary conditions, vessel RAO input)
- `FileRead.py` (Rev1–Rev3) — OrcaFlex `.sim` results post-processor
- `controlFile.py` / `controlFile_MP*.py` — batch case parameterizer (multiple
  vessel heading variants MP2–MP6)
Note: Scripts reside in a client project folder. Legal scan mandatory.
Portable portion = model builder and results reader (generic logic).

### 2. ANSYS Workbench Python Scripts (training material)
Located in: `/mnt/ace/docs/disciplines/drilling/projects/simulation/ANSYS/Scripting_Tools_All_Products_15.0_v1/WB Python/`
- `record.py`, `runWB.py`, `exportData4eachDP.py` — Workbench automation
- `myFunctions.py`, `myFunctions2.py` — utility helpers
- Workshop solutions (ws-3.py, ws-3b.py, ws-3c.py, update.py)
Portability: High for generic Workbench automation patterns.
Note: Verify ANSYS training material license before committing.

### 3. DeepScale Support Scripts (production surveillance)
Located in: `/mnt/ace/docs/disciplines/production/projects/0162_deepscale_support/`
Multiple `.py` files. Likely ESP pump / well performance calculations.
Portability: Medium — depends on client-specific data structures.

### 4. Blender Ocean Scripts (3D visualisation)
Located in: `/mnt/ace/docs/disciplines/drilling/projects/simulation/Animation/Blender/Ocean`
Python scripts for Blender ocean simulation animation.
Portability: Low for engineering calc; reference for visualisation.

## Triage Output Format

`specs/data-sources/script-audit.yaml`:
```yaml
generated: '2026-02-25'
script_categories:
- id: orcaflex-model-builder
  portability: high
  target_repo: digitalmodel
  target_module: digitalmodel.well.orcaflex
  legal_check: required
  scripts:
  - path: /mnt/ace/docs/.../Python/OrcaFlex Riser Model/DrillingRiserModel.py
    description: Full drilling riser OrcaFlex model builder
  - path: /mnt/ace/docs/.../Python/OrcaFlex PostProcessing/Rev3/FileRead.py
    description: OrcaFlex results post-processor (Rev3 = latest)
```

## Legal Protocol

1. Run `scripts/legal/legal-sanity-scan.sh` on each script BEFORE adding to triage YAML
2. If scan blocks → flag as `legal_check: blocked`, add notes on what to redact
3. If scan passes → flag as `legal_check: passed`
4. Committed triage YAML must NOT contain paths from blocked client projects

## Steps

1. After WRK-568: query index for all `.py` files in project archive paths
2. Group by directory pattern (OrcaFlex/, ANSYS/, production/, Animation/)
3. For each group: read 1-2 representative scripts, classify function + portability
4. Legal scan one script per group
5. Write `specs/data-sources/script-audit.yaml`
6. Create follow-up WRK items for each high-portability group

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `specs/data-sources/script-audit.yaml` created with all 4 categories
- [ ] Each category has: portability rating, target_repo, legal_check status
- [ ] At least 10 individual scripts assessed and classified
- [ ] Legal scan run on ≥1 script per category
- [ ] Follow-up WRK items created for all high-portability categories
