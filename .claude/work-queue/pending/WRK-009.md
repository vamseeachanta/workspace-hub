# Reproduce rev30 lower tertiary BSEE field results for repeatability

## What
Reproduce the rev30 lower tertiary results previously provided by Roy using BSEE field data for the same time period. Validate that the analysis pipeline produces identical or equivalent results to confirm repeatability of the methodology.

## Why
Establishing repeatability is a prerequisite for trusting updated results. Before rerunning with new data or expanding scope, we need confidence the analysis pipeline faithfully reproduces known results.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify the rev30 lower tertiary results provided by Roy (reference data)
- [ ] Identify the exact time period and data inputs used in rev30
- [ ] Run the BSEE field analysis pipeline with the same inputs
- [ ] Compare output against Roy's rev30 results
- [ ] Document any discrepancies with explanations
- [ ] Confirm repeatability or flag issues
