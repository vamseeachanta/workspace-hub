# WRK-176: Session Start — Design Code Version Guard

## What
On session start, verify design code editions in use (DNV-ST-F101 2021, API RP 2RD, BS 7910) match latest published editions. Alert if a code has been superseded since last session. Safety-critical for wall thickness and fatigue calculations.

## SME Discussion Required
- **Structural Engineering**: Which codes require edition monitoring? (DNV, API, BS, AWS)
- **Structural Engineering**: What is the acceptable lag between code publication and our update?
- **Naval Architecture**: Should vessel classification society rules (ABS, DNV-GL, LR) be tracked too?

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Build design code edition registry (YAML) with publication dates
- [ ] Phase 2: Implement `hooks/readiness/code-version-guard.sh` — compare registry vs installed
- [ ] Phase 3: Test with DNV-ST-F101 (2007 vs 2021) and API RP 2RD editions

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Design code version guard is a safety-critical check for engineering calculations — agents computing wall thickness or fatigue must use the correct code edition.
- Code edition verification is a simple but important check that agents will run automatically once implemented; the verification logic is stable.
- **Disposition: do now** — safety-critical check with low implementation complexity; execute immediately; wrong code editions in safety calculations are a professional liability.
