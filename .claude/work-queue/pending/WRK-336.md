# Portable installation analysis library — extract generic OrcaFlex automation from project code

## What

Extract reusable OrcaFlex automation logic from project-specific saipem and rock-oil-field
code. Create a portable library: model templating, load case management, results extraction,
fatigue post-processing. No client-specific data in committed code.

## Why

OrcaFlex automation code is currently embedded in project-specific repos with client
references and project-specific assumptions. Extracting generic patterns into a portable
library creates a reusable foundation for future installation analysis projects while
maintaining legal compliance (no client data in shared code).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Portable library package with clean namespace (no client references)
- [ ] OrcaFlex model template creation utilities
- [ ] Load case management: generate, run, track status
- [ ] Results extraction: time-domain, envelope, static
- [ ] Fatigue post-processing: rainflow counting, damage accumulation
- [ ] Legal compliance: legal scan passes with zero violations
- [ ] All extracted code has pytest coverage
- [ ] Documentation: API reference and usage examples
