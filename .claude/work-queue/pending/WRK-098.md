# Create Unified DiffractionSpec for Unit Box Benchmark

## What
Create a unified DiffractionSpec YAML file for the Unit Box hull (1m × 1m × 1m cube) that can be used by all three solvers (AQWA, OrcaWave, BEMRosetta) with identical parameters.

## Why
The trial run showed NO_CONSENSUS because solver inputs weren't matched. A unified spec ensures:
- Same mesh geometry
- Same mass/inertia properties
- Same water depth
- Same frequency/heading discretization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DiffractionSpec YAML created: `specs/modules/benchmark/unit_box_spec.yml`
- [ ] Mesh file: `sample_box.gdf` (existing: 5 panels)
- [ ] Water depth: 500m (or infinite)
- [ ] Frequency range: 0.2–2.0 rad/s (20 points)
- [ ] Headings: 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°
- [ ] Mass properties consistent across all solvers
- [ ] Spec validated against DiffractionSpec schema
