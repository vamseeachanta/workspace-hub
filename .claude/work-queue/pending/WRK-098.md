# Create Unified DiffractionSpec for Unit Box Benchmark

## What
Create a unified DiffractionSpec YAML file for the Unit Box hull (1m × 1m × 1m cube) that can be used by all three solvers (AQWA, OrcaWave, BEMRosetta) with identical parameters.

## Why
The trial run showed NO_CONSENSUS because solver inputs weren't matched. A unified spec ensures:
- Same mesh geometry
- Same mass/inertia properties
- Same water depth
- Same frequency/heading discretization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] DiffractionSpec YAML created: `specs/modules/benchmark/unit_box_spec.yml`
- [x] Mesh file: `sample_box.gdf` (existing: 5 panels)
- [x] Water depth: 100m (deep relative to 1m box)
- [x] Frequency range: 0.2–2.0 rad/s (19 points)
- [x] Dry-run validated with all 3 solvers
- [x] Headings: 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°
- [x] Mass properties consistent: 1025 kg (neutrally buoyant)
- [x] Spec validated - YAML loads and mesh file exists

## Resolution
Created `specs/modules/benchmark/unit_box_spec.yml` with:
- Vessel: UnitBox_Benchmark (1m × 1m × 1m, draft 1m)
- Mass: 1025 kg (displaced volume × water density)
- CG: [0.5, 0.5, -0.5] m
- Frequencies: 19 points from 0.2 to 2.0 rad/s
- Headings: [0, 45, 90, 135, 180] degrees
- Validated: 2026-02-05
