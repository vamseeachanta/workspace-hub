# feat(worldenergydata): create ESG/Carbon Emissions module

## Objective
Create a new ESG and carbon emissions module within `worldenergydata` leveraging Climate TRACE, EDGAR, and the Global Registry of Fossil Fuels (GRFF).

## Context
Sustainability data is a key growth area for the workspace-hub. This module will provide facility-level emissions tracking and national inventory comparisons.

## Plan
1. Create `worldenergydata/esg_carbon/` module.
2. Implement Climate TRACE API client for facility-level O&G emissions.
3. Integrate EDGAR 2025 data for national reference inventories.
4. Implement asset-level carbon intensity modelling using GRFF.
5. Provide unified reporting across these data sources.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Module successfully retrieves data from Climate TRACE.
- National and asset-level emissions comparisons functional.
- Documentation of data sources and methodology included.
