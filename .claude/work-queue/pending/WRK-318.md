# Production forecasting module — Arps decline curve

## What

Implement Arps decline curve analysis (exponential, hyperbolic, harmonic) for oil/gas well
production forecasting. Fit to historical BSEE production data, project EUR, generate forecast
curves. Add CLI: `worldenergydata forecast --api WellID`.

## Why

Decline curve analysis is the industry-standard method for production forecasting and reserves
estimation. Integrating Arps DCA with worldenergydata's existing BSEE production data creates
an end-to-end workflow from historical data to EUR projection without leaving the toolset.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Arps decline models: exponential (b=0), hyperbolic (0<b<1), harmonic (b=1)
- [ ] Curve fitting via least-squares regression to historical production data
- [ ] EUR (Estimated Ultimate Recovery) calculation with economic limit input
- [ ] Forecast curve generation with confidence intervals
- [ ] CLI interface: `worldenergydata forecast --api WellID --model hyperbolic`
- [ ] Integration with existing BSEE production data loader
- [ ] Pytest coverage with synthetic decline data and known EUR results
