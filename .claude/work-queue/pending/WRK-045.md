# OrcaFlex rigid jumper analysis - stress and VIV for various configurations

## What
Develop OrcaFlex analysis capability for rigid jumper systems covering stress analysis and VIV (Vortex-Induced Vibration) assessment. Support various rigid jumper configurations (M-shape, inverted-U, Z-shape, etc.) as parametric inputs for analysis.

## Why
Rigid jumpers are critical subsea connections subject to combined static and dynamic loads, fatigue from VIV, and thermal/pressure effects. Having an OrcaFlex-based analysis framework for multiple configurations enables rapid design iteration, VIV screening, and stress verification across project variants.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OrcaFlex model setup for rigid jumper systems
- [ ] Support for various jumper configurations (M-shape, inverted-U, Z-shape, L-shape, etc.)
- [ ] Stress analysis: combined loading (pressure, thermal, weight, hydrodynamic)
- [ ] VIV analysis: screening and/or detailed assessment (modal analysis, VIV fatigue)
- [ ] Parametric configuration input (geometry, pipe properties, end conditions, span lengths)
- [ ] Results extraction: stresses, utilisation, VIV fatigue life at critical locations
- [ ] Comparison output across configurations
- [ ] Tests validating model setup and results extraction
- [ ] Documentation of analysis methodology and configuration definitions

## Plan

**Target**: `src/digitalmodel/solvers/orcaflex/subsea/rigid_jumper/`

### Existing Assets (reuse)
- `solvers/orcaflex/modular_generator/` — model generation framework, builders
- `solvers/orcaflex/post_processing/` — results extraction, statistics
- `fatigue/` — S-N curves, damage accumulation for VIV fatigue
- `viv/` — **DOES NOT EXIST YET**: no standalone VIV module in digitalmodel. DNV-RP-F105 screening must be implemented from scratch (see Phase 4)
- `structural/` — stress code check patterns

### Phase 1 — Jumper Configuration Library
- `jumper_configs.py` — Define parametric configurations:
  - M-shape: 2 bends, symmetric
  - Inverted-U: single arch
  - Z-shape: 2 bends, asymmetric
  - L-shape: single 90° bend
  - Custom: user-defined bend angles and segment lengths
- Each config: `JumperConfig` dataclass with segment lengths, bend radii, angles, end elevations, pipe properties

### Phase 2 — OrcaFlex Model Generator
- `jumper_model_builder.py`:
  - Generate OrcaFlex Line object with rigid pipe segments
  - Set end connections (fixed, pinned, or flex joint)
  - Apply pipe properties: OD, WT, density, SMYS, contents density
  - Set environmental loads: current profile, wave

### Phase 3 — Stress Analysis
- `jumper_stress.py`:
  - Extract combined stresses: bending + axial + pressure (hoop + radial)
  - Von Mises equivalent stress at critical locations (bends, connections)
  - Code check per DNV-ST-F101 Section 5 (combined loading) with jumper-specific bend stress concentration factors
  - Utilisation ratio output

### Phase 4 — VIV Assessment
- **Prerequisite**: implement DNV-RP-F105 screening method (reduced velocity check) as standalone utility in `src/digitalmodel/structural/viv/` since no VIV module exists. Minimum: in-line VIV screening per Section 4.3.
- `jumper_viv.py`:
  - Modal analysis: natural frequencies of jumper spans
  - VIV screening: simplified reduced velocity check per DNV-RP-F105 (screening only, not full response model)
  - VIV fatigue: if screening fails, compute fatigue damage from VIV response
  - Lock-in assessment per span
  - Define required OrcaFlex output channels and locations for stress extraction

### Phase 5 — Parametric Runner & Output
- `jumper_parametric.py`:
  - Run multiple configurations with same environment
  - Comparison table: max stress, utilisation, VIV fatigue life per config
  - Plotly charts: stress distribution along jumper, VIV screening results

### Phase 6 — Tests
- Model setup validation: verify OrcaFlex geometry matches config
- Stress extraction tests against hand calculations
- VIV screening tests with known reduced velocities
- Parametric runner tests with 2+ configurations

### Dependencies
- Requires OrcFxAPI Python bindings + Orcina license (verify availability and configuration as prerequisite)
- Tests should skip gracefully when OrcFxAPI not installed (use `pytest.importorskip("OrcFxAPI")` with skip reason)

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MINOR | Gemini: MINOR
- **Actions taken**:
  - Marked VIV module as non-existent explicit dependency; added prerequisite to create `structural/viv/` with DNV-RP-F105 screening
  - Clarified VIV scope: simplified screening only (not full response model) per Codex feedback
  - Fixed code check reference: DNV-ST-F101 Section 5 with jumper-specific bend SCFs (removed ambiguous API RP 1111 alternative)
  - Added OrcaFlex output channel specification requirement
  - Added license verification prerequisite per Gemini feedback
  - Added minimal acceptance test pattern for missing OrcFxAPI (pytest.importorskip)
