# OrcaFlex rigid jumper analysis - stress and VIV for various configurations

## What
Develop OrcaFlex analysis capability for rigid jumper systems covering stress analysis and VIV (Vortex-Induced Vibration) assessment. Support various rigid jumper configurations (M-shape, inverted-U, Z-shape, etc.) as parametric inputs for analysis.

## Why
Rigid jumpers are critical subsea connections subject to combined static and dynamic loads, fatigue from VIV, and thermal/pressure effects. Having an OrcaFlex-based analysis framework for multiple configurations enables rapid design iteration, VIV screening, and stress verification across project variants.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OrcaFlex model setup for rigid jumper systems
- [ ] Support for various jumper configurations (M-shape, inverted-U, Z-shape, L-shape, etc.)
- [ ] Stress analysis: combined loading (pressure, thermal, weight, hydrodynamic)
- [ ] VIV analysis: screening and/or detailed assessment (modal analysis, VIV fatigue)
- [ ] Parametric configuration input (geometry, pipe properties, end conditions, span lengths)
- [ ] Results extraction: stresses, utilisation, VIV fatigue life at critical locations
- [ ] Comparison output across configurations
- [ ] Tests validating model setup and results extraction
- [ ] Documentation of analysis methodology and configuration definitions
