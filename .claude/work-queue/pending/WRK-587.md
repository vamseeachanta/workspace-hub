# Evaluate Code_Aster for Large-Scale Topside Structural FEA

## What

Evaluate Code_Aster (code-aster.org) as a potential open-source alternative
for large-scale topside structural FEA within digitalmodel.

## Why

Code_Aster is a mature GPL FEA solver (EDF-backed) with extensive
structural mechanics capabilities. Could complement OpenFOAM for
structural analysis where commercial FEA is not available.

## Deliverables

- Installation test on ace-linux-1/2
- Benchmark: simple structural problem (beam, plate, or frame)
- Comparison with existing digitalmodel structural solvers
- Go/no-go recommendation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Code_Aster installed and functional
- [ ] Python API (salome-meca or standalone) tested
- [ ] Benchmark problem executed and validated
- [ ] Comparison documented: capabilities, license, integration effort
- [ ] Recommendation with rationale
