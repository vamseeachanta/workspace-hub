# Complete LNG terminal data pipeline — from config to working collection

## What
Move the LNG terminals module from config-only state to a working data collection and reporting pipeline. Currently the module has CLI and collector framework but no active data import. Reports folder is empty.

## Why
LNG terminals is counted among the "15+ data sources" on the website. The module framework exists but doesn't collect any data, creating a gap between marketing and capability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] At least one LNG terminal data source actively collecting
- [ ] Terminal locations, capacity, and design specifications populated
- [ ] Basic report/visualization output
- [ ] CLI command to run collection and generate report
- [ ] Tests with sample data
