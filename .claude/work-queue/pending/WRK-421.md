# feat(calculations): implement API BULL 5C3 Formulas and Calculation...

## Standard
- **ID**: API BULL 5C3 Formulas and Calculations for Casing, Tubing, Drill & Line Pipe
- **Title**: API BULL 5C3 Formulas and Calculations for Casing, Tubing, Drill & Line Pipe
- **Org**: API
- **Document**: `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/API/Bulletins/API_BULL_5C3_Formulas_and_Calculations_for_Casing,_Tubing,_Drill_&_Line_Pipe.pdf` (SHA: `d6b39978766d3543...`)
- **Summary**: API standard : API BULL 5C3 Formulas and Calculations for Casing, Tubing, Drill & Line Pipe
- **Discipline**: pipeline

## Target Module
