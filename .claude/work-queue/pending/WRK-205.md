# Skills knowledge graph — capability metadata and relationship layer beyond flat index

## What

With 468 skills across 16 domains and a 34KB README index, the current flat-index approach
scales linearly with size. Add a lightweight relationship and capability metadata layer to
enable semantic discovery and tiered/dynamic loading without requiring a full graph database.

## Why

Triggered by review of ArsContexta and DeepIQ industrial knowledge graph whitepaper patterns.
Key insight: taxonomy (what we have) + ontology (relationships) + KG instantiation = full
discoverability. The current index must be fully loaded to find anything; relationships and
capability tags would allow just-in-time loading of only the relevant subset.

Known pain points:
- 34KB README index is expensive to include in context for every session
- No way to ask "which skills compose into a drilling-analysis workflow?"
- No dependency or conflict relationships between skills
- 115 diverged skills have no canonical linkage back to hub versions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each SKILL.md gains a structured `capabilities:`, `requires:`, and `see_also:` frontmatter block (populated for at least the top 3 domains: engineering, data, development)
- [ ] A `SKILLS_GRAPH.yaml` or `skills-map.json` at `.claude/skills/` root encodes cross-skill relationships (composes, alternatives, requires)
- [ ] Category-level sub-indexes created (e.g., `engineering/INDEX.md`) so only the relevant slice need be loaded
- [ ] Main README becomes a meta-index of sub-indexes (reduces load-time for 80% of sessions)
- [ ] `_diverged/` skills include a `canonical_ref:` field pointing to hub version

## Plan

Route B — inline plan. Approved by user 2026-02-19.

**Sequence**: Graph → README restructure → Category indexes → Metadata frontmatter → Diverged canonical_ref

1. **`SKILLS_GRAPH.yaml`** at `.claude/skills/` root
   - Typed edges: `composes`, `requires`, `alternatives`, `see_also`
   - Start with workspace-hub cluster (already bidirectional from session work)
   - Add ~30 known cross-domain edges
2. **README → meta-index** (~50 lines)
   - Points to `<category>/INDEX.md` per domain; eliminates 34KB load cost
3. **Per-category `INDEX.md`** (all 12 active categories)
   - Scripted from existing frontmatter: name + 1-line description + tags
4. **`capabilities:` / `requires:` / `see_also:` frontmatter**
   - Hand-authored: workspace-hub cluster (10 skills)
   - Script-generated skeleton: engineering (66), data (~40), development (~30)
5. **`_diverged/` `canonical_ref:`** — scripted, all 115 files

*Awaiting `plan_reviewed: true` — needs Codex/Gemini cross-review before moving to working.*
