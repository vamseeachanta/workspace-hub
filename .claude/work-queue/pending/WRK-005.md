# Clean up email using AI (when safe)

## What
Use AI tools to clean up and organize email inbox. Only process emails where automated actions are safe and reversible. Categorize messages, clear spam/junk, and flag important items while ensuring no accidental deletions occur.

## Why
Reduce email clutter and improve inbox organization to make important communications easier to find and manage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Email categorized into meaningful groups
- [ ] Spam and junk mail archived to dedicated folder
- [ ] Important emails flagged for attention
- [ ] No accidental deletions of legitimate email
- [ ] All actions are safe and reversible

## Plan

- **Step 0**: Identify email provider (Gmail/Outlook). Create OAuth app credentials and request appropriate scopes (`gmail.readonly` + `gmail.modify` for Gmail; `Mail.ReadWrite` for Outlook Graph API). Store credentials in `.env`, never in code
- **Step 1**: Assess email provider API access and rate limits (Gmail: 250 quota units/second)
- **Step 2**: Build read-only scanner that categorizes emails (spam, newsletters, actionable, archive-worthy). Use a local rules-based classifier for obvious categories (sender domain matching for newsletters, existing spam folder contents) supplemented by LLM classification for ambiguous emails. Email bodies sent to external LLM must be stripped of PII or use a local model. Initial scan limited to most recent 90 days; historical processing deferred to subsequent runs
- **Step 3**: Present categorization summary for user review before any actions
- **Step 4**: Implement safe operations only: archive (not delete), mark as read, label/folder assignment
- **Step 5**: All actions logged and reversible (maintain undo log)
- **Note**: No deletion without explicit user confirmation per batch

### Review Notes

- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR
- **Actions taken**:
  - Added Step 0 for OAuth credential setup with provider-specific scopes
  - Expanded Step 2 with AI model selection (rules-based + LLM fallback) and PII handling
  - Added 90-day scope constraint to Step 2 for initial scan
  - Added rate limit awareness to Step 1
  - Reworded acceptance criterion from "Spam and junk mail cleared" to "archived to dedicated folder"
