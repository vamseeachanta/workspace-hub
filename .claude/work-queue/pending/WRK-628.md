# feat(frontierdeepwater): Client AI Roadshow — Phased Engineering AI Adoption Programme

## What

Umbrella tracker for the full phased AI adoption initiative targeting engineering teams.
Three phases, executed over 1–6 months:

```
Phase 1: Desktop Q&A Demo (Week 1)      → WRK-625, WRK-626, WRK-627
Phase 2: Engineering Chatbot (1-3 mo)   → TBD WRK items post-demo
Phase 3: Advanced Integration (3-6 mo)  → TBD WRK items post-pilot
```

### Phase 1 — Desktop Q&A Demo (active)

Two clients, each with discipline-specific demo builds:

**Client 1** — rigid jumpers, FFS (pipe), GoA data:
- **WRK-625** — Day 1: system prompts + knowledge base [30% done]
- **WRK-626** — Days 2-3: calculation templates + OrcaFlex data processing
- **WRK-627** — Days 4-5: multi-step workflows + BSEE/GoA data + demo package

**Client 2** — diffraction analysis, FFS (plates), GoA analysis, maritime legal consulting:
- **WRK-629** — Day 1-2: system prompts + knowledge base + diffraction/plate FFS context
- **WRK-630** — Days 3-5: workflows + GoA data + demo package

Demo target: 1 week per client. Success = both clients agree to a 2-week pilot.

### Phase 2 — Microsoft Teams Chatbot (post-demo)

Both clients have Microsoft Teams — deploy via Azure Bot Service + Claude API.
One bot per client, each loaded with their discipline-specific system prompt.
- **WRK-631** — Teams bot integration, both clients, Option A (API) → Option B (RAG)
Architecture: start with Option A (Claude API + system prompt), graduate to Option B (RAG
backend with company doc index) as usage and doc volume grows.

### Phase 3 — Advanced Integration (post-pilot)

Multi-agent workflows: OrcaFlex batch parametric studies, knowledge base indexing,
AI-assisted QA/peer review. New WRK items when Phase 2 is operational.

## Why

Engineering AI demos create the highest ROI pathway to recurring AI services revenue.
A successful 1-week demo → pilot → chatbot deployment represents a repeatable template
applicable to other client disciplines and firms. The roadshow format (phased, low
initial cost, measurable ROI) is designed to convert demo curiosity into paid engagement.

Expected benefits demonstrated in the demo:
| Task | Before | After | Reduction |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Code reference lookup | 15-30 min | 1-2 min | 90% |
| Preliminary sizing | 2-4 hr | 15-30 min | 85% |
| Calc memo drafting | 4-8 hr | 1-2 hr | 75% |
| Simulation data extraction | 1-2 hr/case | 5-10 min | 90% |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Phase 1 demo delivered (WRK-625 + WRK-626 + WRK-627 complete)
- [ ] Demo run with SME1 and SME2 — feedback captured in `ai-initiatives/pilot/feedback.md`
- [ ] Post-demo debrief: go/no-go for Phase 2 chatbot documented
- [ ] Phase 2 WRK items created if demo succeeds
- [ ] ROI tracking started: `ai-initiatives/pilot/time_savings_log.md`
- [ ] Aceengineer-website portfolio entry updated (brochure_status: synced)

## Timeline

| Week | Milestone | WRK |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Week 1 | Demo build | WRK-625/626/627 |
| Week 2 | Demo with SME1 + SME2 | this item |
| Week 3 | Pilot (2-3 engineers/team) | new WRK |
| Week 4 | Evaluate ROI, Phase 2 decision | new WRK |

## Agentic AI Horizon

This is a GTM (go-to-market) compound item. Phase 1 is Codex/Claude executable now.
Phase 2/3 depend on demo outcome — defer those WRK items until feedback is in.
The repeatable roadshow template created here is reusable across other client firms.
