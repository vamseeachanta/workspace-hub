## Description

4 GitHub Actions workflows are disabled (workflow_dispatch only) because they were written for Node.js but this is a Python/bash workspace:

- `baseline-check.yml` — uses `npm ci`, `actions/setup-node@v4` with `cache: 'npm'`
- `multi-ai-review.yml` — references missing `scripts/ai-workflow/` directory
- `baseline-audit.yml` — same Node.js mismatch
- `refactor-analysis.yml` — same Node.js mismatch

## Tasks

- [ ] Rewrite `baseline-check.yml` to use `uv`/`pytest` instead of `npm`
- [ ] Rewrite or remove `multi-ai-review.yml` (create `scripts/ai-workflow/` or use existing tooling)
- [ ] Rewrite or remove `baseline-audit.yml`
- [ ] Rewrite or remove `refactor-analysis.yml`
- [ ] Re-enable push/schedule triggers after rewrite
- [ ] Verify all workflows pass on main

## Context

Disabled in commit `1fc6d47` on 2026-01-31. Identified during reflect review on 2026-02-03.
