# feat: Chatbot Fundamentals — Shared Persona, Tone, Deployment Tiers, Pitch Template

## What

Create a shared `ai-initiatives/shared/chatbot_fundamentals.md` document and embed
persona/tone standards into ALL client system prompts (WRK-625, WRK-629).

Source: `~/Downloads/Engineering_Chatbot_Pitch_OilGas.md`

### 1. Shared Fundamentals File

`ai-initiatives/shared/chatbot_fundamentals.md`

#### Persona Design Principles (apply to ALL system prompts)

Every system prompt (rigid jumper, pipeline, structural/diffraction, maritime legal)
must embed these four principles as a closing `## Persona and Tone` section:

```markdown
## Persona and Tone

**Technical precision** — use correct terminology; never hand-wave engineering details.
State specific code clause references, formula notation, and unit conventions.

**Practical orientation** — lead with the answer, then the derivation. Engineers need
solutions, not academic preambles. Offer next steps or follow-on checks.

**Appropriate caution** — engineering outputs carry safety and environmental consequences.
Flag assumptions explicitly. Distinguish between screening-level and detailed analysis.

**Transparent reasoning** — show the logic chain. Engineers verify; they don't just accept.
Step-by-step derivation: input → formula → substitution → result → acceptance check.

**Standard disclaimer (include on all calculation outputs):**
> "This output is for preliminary/informational purposes only and requires independent
> verification by a qualified engineer before use in engineering decisions."
```

#### Known Limitations (embed in system prompt preamble)

```markdown
## Known Limitations

- Hallucination risk on highly specific technical values (pipe body properties,
  S-N curve ordinates, proprietary code clauses) — always cite the source standard
  and instruct the user to verify against the actual document
- No access to proprietary project data unless explicitly provided in the conversation
- Cannot execute engineering software (OrcaFlex, AQWA, SACS) — assists with
  model setup guidance, parameter recommendations, and post-processing interpretation
- All outputs require qualified engineer review before use in deliverables
```

#### Deployment Tiers (context for client conversations)

| Tier | Description | Readiness |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 | Knowledge assistant — Q&A, documentation, scripting help | Ready today |
| Tier 2 | RAG system connected to project document libraries | Feasible (weeks) |
| Tier 3 | Autonomous engineering agent with analysis capabilities | 2–3 years |

Current demo and Phase 2 chatbot = **Tier 1/2**. Tier 3 is the long-term vision.

#### Key Differentiator (for client pitch conversations)

> "You're not buying AI — you're buying engineering judgment encoded into a system
> that scales. Domain expertise is the competitive moat."

### 2. Client Pitch One-Pager

`ai-initiatives/shared/client_pitch_oilgas.md`

Adapted from the source document for use in client conversations:
- Current state of technology (what works, known limits, deployment readiness)
- 5-phase capability roadmap (Knowledge Base → RAG → Pre-Processor → Review → Advisor)
- Pricing structure (Starter / Project / Enterprise)
- Business case: 30-50% time reduction on lookup/drafting/data extraction

### 3. Patch All Existing System Prompts

Apply `## Persona and Tone` and `## Known Limitations` sections to:
- `ai-initiatives/prompts/rigid_jumper_assistant.md` (WRK-625)
- `ai-initiatives/prompts/pipeline_assistant.md` (WRK-625)
- `ai-initiatives-client2/prompts/structural_offshore_assistant.md` (WRK-629)
- `ai-initiatives-client2/prompts/maritime_legal_consultant.md` (WRK-629)

Note: this item should run BEFORE or ALONGSIDE WRK-625/629 so the fundamentals are
baked in from the start rather than patched in later.

## Why

Tone and persona consistency across all clients is the difference between a demo that
feels like a toy and one that feels like a senior engineer. The four principles
(precision, practicality, caution, transparency) + the standard disclaimer protect
against the two biggest objections: "can we trust this?" and "who's liable?".

The client pitch one-pager turns the demo follow-up into a structured commercial
conversation rather than an ad-hoc explanation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `ai-initiatives/shared/chatbot_fundamentals.md` created with all 4 sections
- [ ] `ai-initiatives/shared/client_pitch_oilgas.md` created (adapted from source, no names)
- [ ] `## Persona and Tone` section present in all 4 system prompt files
- [ ] `## Known Limitations` section present in all 4 system prompt files
- [ ] Standard disclaimer wording consistent across all prompts
- [ ] Legal scan passes (source doc is internal — no client names in output files)

## Agentic AI Horizon

Simple: Codex drafts the shared files; standard text injection into prompt templates.
No engineering judgment required. Run this concurrently with or before WRK-625/629.

## Session Note (2026-02-27)

Context: `~/Downloads/Engineering_Chatbot_Pitch_OilGas.md` (already read this session)
contains the source material — 4 persona principles, standard disclaimer, deployment
tiers (T1/T2/T3), and client pitch one-pager. This WRK item should be executed BEFORE
WRK-625 and WRK-629, as the shared fundamentals patch all system prompts.
