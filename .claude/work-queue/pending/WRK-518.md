# feat(doris/pipeline): Implement DNV OSS 006 — DNV OSS 006 (1981) Rules for Submarine Pipeline Sy

## Standard
- **Standard**: DNV OSS 006
- **Full title**: DNV OSS 006 (1981) Rules for Submarine Pipeline Systems
- **Domain**: pipeline
- **Document path**: `/mnt/ace/0000 O&G/0000 Codes & Standards/DNV/DNV Offshore Service Specifications/DNV OSS 006/DNV OSS 006 (1981) Rules for Submarine Pipeline Systems.PDF`

## What

Implement engineering calculations and data models from **DNV OSS 006**
in the `doris` repository, module `pipeline`.

This standard was identified in Phase C/E of WRK-309 (Document Intelligence)
as a gap — the document exists on the drives but its content has not been
implemented in the target repo.

## Why

**DNV OSS 006** is a key industry standard in the `pipeline` domain.
Implementing its calculations enables agents and engineers to perform
rigorous code-compliant analysis directly from the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core calculations / design checks implemented with unit tests
- [ ] Input validation at parameter boundaries
- [ ] Docstring cites the standard clause/equation numbers
- [ ] Example usage verified against standard worked example (if available)
- [ ] Cross-review passed via `scripts/review/cross-review.sh`
