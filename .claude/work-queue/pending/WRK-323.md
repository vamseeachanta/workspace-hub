# Covered call analyser — option chain ingestion and premium yield calculator

## What

Build a covered call analysis tool. Ingest option chain data (identify suitable API/library),
calculate premium yield, annualised return, downside protection, and break-even price for each
strike. Output: ranked covered call opportunities for current holdings.

## Why

Covered calls are a core income strategy for equity portfolios. Automating option chain
analysis and premium yield calculation for current holdings enables systematic identification
of the best covered call opportunities by strike price and expiry, replacing ad-hoc manual
screening.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Option chain data ingestion (yfinance or equivalent library)
- [ ] Premium yield calculation: premium / current price (annualised)
- [ ] Downside protection: premium / current price (absolute)
- [ ] Break-even price: current price - premium received
- [ ] If-called return: (strike - current price + premium) / current price (annualised)
- [ ] Ranked output table: sorted by annualised premium yield per holding
- [ ] Filter controls: minimum days to expiry, maximum delta, minimum premium
- [ ] Pytest coverage with sample option chain data
