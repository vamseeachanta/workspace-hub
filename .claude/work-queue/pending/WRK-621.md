# Shallow Foundations (Phase 4)

## What

Implement shallow foundation bearing capacity calculations for offshore
gravity base structures and mudmats, covering undrained (Brinch Hansen)
and drained (Terzaghi/Meyerhof) methods with sliding and overturning checks.

## Why

Gravity base structures and mudmats are common offshore foundations that
require bearing capacity verification. groundhog provides some methods
but is GPL — core calculations must be independent.

## Scope

### Packages
- groundhog (GPL-3.0) — optional extra, cross-validation only

### Standards
- DNV-RP-C212 (Sec 5)
- ISO 19901-4
- API RP 2GEO

## Deliverables

- `geotechnical/foundations/undrained_bearing.py` — Brinch Hansen general formula
- `geotechnical/foundations/drained_bearing.py` — Terzaghi/Meyerhof
- `geotechnical/foundations/mudmat_design.py` — iterative sizing for given load
- `geotechnical/foundations/gravity_base.py` — sliding, overturning, bearing checks
- Test suite validated against Brinch Hansen (1970) worked examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Undrained bearing capacity via Brinch Hansen general formula
- [ ] Drained bearing capacity via Terzaghi/Meyerhof method
- [ ] Iterative mudmat sizing for given vertical + horizontal loads
- [ ] Gravity base foundation checks: sliding, overturning, bearing
- [ ] Optional groundhog adapter with GPL guard pattern
- [ ] Tests validated against Brinch Hansen (1970) and DNV-RP-C212 examples
- [ ] Cross-review passes (Codex hard gate)
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Integration Points

- **WRK-383** (Structural): gravity base structural design feeds foundation loads
- **installation_checklist.py** (line 38-48): reuse FoundationType enums
