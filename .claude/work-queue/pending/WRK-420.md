# feat(calculations): implement ISO-TR 10400, 1st Ed (2007) Equations...

## Standard
- **ID**: ISO-TR 10400, 1st Ed (2007) Equations and calculations for the properties of casing, tubing, drill pipe and line pipe used as casing or tubing
- **Title**: ISO TR 10400, 1st Ed (2007) Equations and calculations for the properties of casing, tubing, drill pipe and line pipe us
- **Org**: ISO
- **Document**: `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/ISO/ISO-TR_10400,_1st_Ed_(2007)_Equations_and_calculations_for_the_properties_of_casing,_tubing,_drill_pipe_and_line_pipe_used_as_casing_or_tubing.pdf` (SHA: `f572be13fe3c534f...`)
- **Summary**: ISO standard : ISO TR 10400, 1st Ed (2007) Equations and calculations for the properties of casing, tubing, drill pipe and line pipe used as casing or tubing
- **Discipline**: pipeline

## Target Module
- **Repo**: assetutilities
- **Module**: `calculations`
- **Current status**: gap (no implementation found)
- **Capability tier target**: Tier 1 (deterministic calculation)

## What to Implement
ISO standard : ISO TR 10400, 1st Ed (2007) Equations and calculations for the properties of casing, tubing, drill pipe and line pipe used as casing or tubing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Function implements ISO-TR 10400, 1st Ed (2007) Equations... calculation
- [ ] Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases
- [ ] Result validated against worked example in standard (if available)
- [ ] Module registry updated: status → implemented

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Standards implementation is direct engineering value: agents can invoke
  ISO-TR 10400, 1st Ed (2007) Equations... calculations in automated workflows
- **Disposition: invest now** — engineering standards code is foundational
  and non-perishable
