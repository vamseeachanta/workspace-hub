# Scale Hull Panel Meshes to Target Principal Dimensions

## What
Build a hull scaling pipeline that takes a cataloged hull panel mesh (from WRK-114) and scales it to match target principal dimensions (length, beam, draft) for use in diffraction/hydrodynamic analysis. Support both geometric (uniform) and parametric (non-uniform) scaling approaches.

## Why
The hull library contains representative meshes at fixed dimensions. Real analysis requires meshes at project-specific dimensions. Rather than re-creating geometry from scratch, scaling existing panels to target L/B/D ratios is the industry-standard rapid workflow. This directly enables the parametric hull pipeline (WRK-043) and solver benchmarking (WRK-031).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scaling function that takes a PanelMesh + target L/B/D and returns a scaled PanelMesh
- [ ] Geometric (uniform) scaling: single scale factor applied to all vertices
- [ ] Parametric (non-uniform) scaling: independent X/Y/Z scale factors from L/B/D ratios
- [ ] Preserve panel topology (connectivity unchanged, only vertex positions scaled)
- [ ] Output scaled mesh as GDF file ready for diffraction solvers
- [ ] Validate scaled mesh: no degenerate panels, correct bounding box, normals consistent
- [ ] Integration with hull catalog: select source hull by hull_id, scale to target, export
- [ ] Tests covering both scaling modes, edge cases, and round-trip verification
