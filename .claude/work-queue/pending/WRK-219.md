# Batch Drilling Economics Analysis — Campaign Scheduling and Cost Optimization

## Context

Newsletter article by Radmir Ganiev, PhD ("Drilling Advisor's Logbook", Feb 10, 2026):
"Batch Drilling: How Operators Save Millions in Deepwater and Offshore Campaigns."
Batch drilling — sequencing multiple wells in a single rig campaign to share mobilization
costs, optimize rig setup time, and exploit learning curves — is a key economic lever in
deepwater development where rig day rates dominate project economics.

## What

An economic analysis module for batch drilling campaign optimization, building on the cost
framework from WRK-019 (drilling/completion/intervention cost data):

### Part 1 — Batch Drilling Data Model

```python
class DrillingSite:
    well_id: str
    field_name: str
    location_coords: tuple[float, float]  # lat/lon
    water_depth_ft: float
    planned_md_ft: float                  # measured depth
    well_type: str                        # exploration, development, appraisal
    bore_design: str                      # slim, standard (link to WRK-218)
    mpd_required: bool                    # link to WRK-168

class DrillCampaign:
    campaign_id: str
    rig_name: str
    rig_day_rate_usd: float
    mobilization_cost_usd: float
    wells: list[DrillingSite]
    sequence: list[str]                   # ordered well_ids for batch
    shared_bha_configs: dict              # BHA configs reused across wells
    learning_curve_factor: float          # time reduction per well in batch (0-1)
```

### Part 2 — Campaign Scheduling Optimizer

Core economic calculations for batch sequence optimization:

1. **Mobilization cost amortization** — share one-time rig mobilization across N wells
   in a batch vs. individual campaigns

2. **Learning curve model** — time reduction on well N vs. well 1 in the same batch:
   - Industry learning curve factor: ~10-15% time reduction per doubling of wells
   - Cumulative average model: T(N) = T(1) × N^(log(LC)/log(2))
   - Sensitive to formation similarity, crew consistency, BHA design reuse

3. **BHA standardization benefit** — reusing the same BHA configuration across multiple
   wells in a batch reduces trip time and equipment handling costs

4. **Sequence optimization** — for N wells, find the ordering that minimizes total rig time:
   - Geographic clustering: minimize vessel/rig transit between well locations
   - Formation clustering: group wells by similar geology to maximize BHA reuse
   - NPV ordering: high-value (producer) wells earlier in sequence (cash flow timing)

5. **Batch vs. standalone NPV comparison**:
   - Batch NPV: amortized mobilization + learning curve gains vs. flat day rate × days
   - Standalone NPV: full mobilization per well, no learning curve
   - Break-even analysis: minimum N wells to justify batch commitment

### Part 3 — BSEE Campaign History Analysis (worldenergydata)

Mine existing BSEE drilling activity data to identify historical batch campaigns:

- **Batch detection heuristic**: same rig drilling wells in the same field/block within
  a 12-month window → likely batch campaign
- **Batch vs. standalone metrics**: compare average well duration for batched vs.
  standalone wells in the same depth band and era
- **Regional patterns**: GoM deepwater batch frequency by water depth, era (2010-2025)
- **Learning curve validation**: fit learning curve factor to BSEE time series for
  detected batch campaigns

### Part 4 — Content Visualization

Supporting charts for blog post candidate (see WRK-080):
- Batch NPV vs. standalone NPV: savings as function of N wells and day rate
- Learning curve chart: cumulative well time vs. batch position
- Geographic clustering map: well locations colored by optimal batch assignment

## Why

- **Builds on WRK-019**: The drilling cost layer (day rates, mobilization costs) provides
  the input data. Batch optimization is the decision tool that sits on top.
- **Common client question**: "Should we batch these wells or run independent campaigns?"
  is one of the first economic questions in field development planning.
- **Data opportunity**: BSEE activity data (WRK-016, WRK-018) contains sequential well
  drilling history that can validate batch economics against real campaigns.
- **GTM content**: A data-backed analysis of GoM batch drilling patterns demonstrates both
  data access and economic modeling capability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] DrillingSite and DrillCampaign data models defined with tests
      (models.py — DrillingSite, DrillCampaign dataclasses with learning_curve_factor, shared_bha_configs)
- [x] Learning curve model implemented with configurable factor
      (economics.py — Wright learning curve: T(N) = T(1) × N^(log(LC)/log(2)), configurable learning_curve_factor)
- [x] Batch vs. standalone NPV comparison function
      (economics.py — compare_batch_vs_standalone_npv with discount rate and production profile inputs)
- [x] Mobilization cost amortization calculator
      (economics.py — amortize_mobilization_cost: one-time mobilization shared across N wells)
- [x] BSEE batch detection heuristic (same rig, same field/block, 12-month window)
      (bsee_batch_detector.py — detect_batch_campaigns using rig/field/block grouping with 365-day window)
- [x] Learning curve validation: fit to BSEE historical batch sequences
      (bsee_batch_detector.py — fit_learning_curve using detected campaign sequences)
- [ ] Sequence optimizer: geographic clustering for N wells
      (DEFERRED: geographic clustering for optimal well sequencing deferred per scope reduction)
- [ ] NPV ordering: producer-first sequencing with discount rate sensitivity
      (DEFERRED: producer-first NPV sequencing deferred per scope reduction)
- [x] Tests: unit tests for all calculators, integration with WRK-019 cost layer
      (22 tests passing: models, economics, batch_detector; integration with WRK-019 day_rates.yml)
- [ ] Blog post visualizations (3 charts per Part 4 spec)
      (DEFERRED: Plotly batch NPV chart, learning curve chart, and geographic clustering map deferred)

## Dependencies

- **Blocked by WRK-019** (drilling cost layer must exist for mobilization costs and
  day rate data)
- **Related to WRK-218** (well bore design type — slim vs. standard — affects well
  duration and BHA configuration choices in batch planning)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Batch drilling economics analysis (campaign scheduling and cost optimisation) extends the worldenergydata cost layer (WRK-019) into campaign planning — high value for multi-well project clients.
- Campaign scheduling and cost optimisation will benefit from improved constrained optimisation capabilities in AI models; but the domain-specific drilling cost models must be in place first.
- **Disposition: do now** — builds directly on WRK-019; the combination of cost data and campaign scheduling creates a commercially valuable drilling economics tool.
