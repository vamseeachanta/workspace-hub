# Offshore Decommissioning Analytics — Data-Driven Lifecycle Planning Module

## Context

Two Acteon/Intermoor articles (Feb 2026) frame offshore decommissioning as a strategic
analytics problem, not just an operational execution problem:

1. **"Offshore Decommissioning: Five Ways Operators Can Lead with Insight over Instinct"**
   — Five challenges: cost forecasting, data gaps, environmental/safety risk, regulatory
   navigation, capacity constraints. Core message: decommissioning planning must start during
   operations, not at end-of-life.
   URL: https://acteon.com/insights/blogs/offshore-decommissioning-five-ways-operators-can-lead-with-insight-over-instinct

2. **Case Study: SPM Calm Buoy Decommissioning (Gulf of Thailand, 70m)**
   — Intermoor decommissioned 2 SPM systems while maintaining live pipeline connections.
   Foam injection, mooring/riser removal, pile cutting 5m below mudline.

3. **Case Study: FSO Disconnection, Removal, Towing (Gulf of Thailand, 70m)**
   — Intermoor's first APAC decommissioning campaign. Flexible riser/mooring disconnection,
   FSO tow to Singapore, simultaneous pipeline project.

## What

Build a decommissioning analytics module addressing the five strategic challenges
identified in the Acteon framework:

### Challenge 1 — Cost Forecasting (worldenergydata)

Extend WRK-019's cost framework to include decommissioning costs:

```python
class DecommissioningCostEstimate:
    asset_type: str          # "fixed_platform", "floating", "SPM", "FSO", "pipeline"
    water_depth_ft: float
    structural_weight_tonnes: float
    region: str              # "gom", "north_sea", "apac", "west_africa"
    well_count: int          # number of wells to P&A
    estimated_cost_usd: float
    confidence: str          # "high", "medium", "low"
    year: int
    data_source: str
```

Reference data sources:
- BSEE Platform Removal Notices (public, contains operator, platform ID, year)
- OSPAR Commission decommissioning reports (North Sea)
- OGA/NSTA decommissioning cost estimates (UK)
- Published industry benchmarks (Wood Mackenzie, Rystad)

### Challenge 2 — Data Gaps (worldenergydata + digitalmodel)

Late-life assets often lack current integrity records. Analytics approach:

1. **BSEE late-life asset identification**: platforms with production declining >80% over 5
   years, or no production for 12+ months → flag as decommissioning candidates
2. **Data completeness scoring**: for each flagged asset, score data availability across:
   - As-built drawings (binary: BSEE filing exists?)
   - Last inspection report date (from BSEE/SEMS filings)
   - Well integrity records (number of wells with P&A bonds filed)
   - Mooring system documentation
3. **Digital twin readiness assessment**: classify assets as "twin-ready", "data-gap", or
   "survey-required" based on completeness score

### Challenge 3 — Environmental and Safety Risk

Risk scoring for decommissioning operations:

1. **Structural condition proxy**: age + water depth + incident history from BSEE data
2. **Environmental sensitivity**: reef habitat designation, proximity to marine protected areas
3. **Live pipeline proximity**: flag assets with neighboring live pipelines (like SPM case study)
4. **Decommissioning sequence risk**: which assets to prioritize for removal given
   risk score and cost efficiency

### Challenge 4 — Regulatory Navigation (worldenergydata)

Track decommissioning regulatory requirements by region:

```python
class DecommissioningRegulation:
    region: str
    regulatory_body: str       # "BSEE", "NSTA", "PSA", "ANP"
    requirement_type: str      # "well_PA", "structure_removal", "pipeline_flushing"
    lead_time_months: int      # typical approval lead time
    key_threshold: str         # e.g., "structures >300t must be fully removed"
    reference_doc: str
```

- BSEE: NTL 2010-G05 (platform removal) and BSEE bonding requirements
- UK: NSTA decommissioning programmes (Section 29 notices)
- Norway: PSA — facilities ordinance requirements

### Challenge 5 — Capacity Constraints

Market availability tracker for decommissioning specialist services:

- Heavy lift vessel availability (link to vessel fleet data WRK-103)
- Dive support vessel market (shallow water decommissioning)
- P&A specialist rig availability
- Expected demand surge years (based on North Sea platform age distribution)

### Content Asset (aceengineer-website)

Blog post: "The Five Data Problems in Offshore Decommissioning (And How BSEE Data Helps
Solve Three of Them)" — see WRK-080 for candidate entry

## Why

- **Growing market**: North Sea decommissioning spend projected at $50B+ over next decade.
  GoM decommissioning backlog is significant. A&CE's BSEE data access is directly applicable.
- **BSEE data ready**: Platform Removal Notices, well P&A bonds, production decline data —
  all exist in BSEE public data and worldenergydata pipeline. WRK-016 and WRK-018 already
  bring in multi-regional field data that supports the data gap analysis.
- **Digital twins connection**: WRK-168 (MPD) and WRK-163 (risk framework) already build
  toward data-driven well operations. Decommissioning extends the same philosophy to asset end-of-life.
- **GTM service line**: "Decommissioning analytics" is a distinct, defensible service line
  that operators can justify internally — budget exists, regulatory deadlines create urgency.
- **Case study credibility**: Acteon/Intermoor case studies (SPM + FSO in GoT) demonstrate
  real-world scope. A&CE's analytics approach sits above the operational execution layer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] DecommissioningCostEstimate model with BSEE platform removal data ingestion
- [ ] Late-life asset identification algorithm (production decline threshold)
- [ ] Data completeness scoring for candidate decommissioning assets
- [ ] Environmental risk scoring model
- [ ] Regulatory requirements database (BSEE, NSTA, PSA, minimum)
- [ ] Vessel capacity market tracker (linked to WRK-103 vessel fleet)
- [ ] BSEE platform removal count: how many platforms removed per year (2010-2025)?
- [ ] Blog post candidate content (see WRK-080)
- [ ] Tests: unit tests for all models, integration with existing BSEE pipeline

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Offshore decommissioning analytics is an emerging high-value market; data-driven lifecycle planning modules are commercially relevant as GoM and North Sea fields age.
- Decommissioning analytics will benefit from improved regulatory document parsing and cost modelling AI in 3–4 months.
- **Disposition: groundwork now, park rest** — define the data schema and regulatory sources now; defer the full analytics module to when AI-assisted regulatory parsing is better.
