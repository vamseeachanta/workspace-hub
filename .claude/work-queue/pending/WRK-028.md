# AQWA Postprocessing - RAOs and Verification

## What
Build postprocessing pipeline for AQWA results. Extract RAOs (Response Amplitude Operators) for all 6 DOFs, generate verification plots, and provide insight/summary reports comparing against expected behavior or reference data.

## Why
Raw AQWA output needs structured extraction and visualization to be useful for engineering decisions. RAO plots, convergence checks, and comparison against benchmarks are standard deliverables in diffraction analysis workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Parse AQWA output files (LIS, results databases)
- [x] Extract RAOs for surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch, yaw
- [x] Generate RAO plots (amplitude + phase vs wave period/frequency)
- [x] Verification checks (symmetry, zero-frequency limits, resonance identification)
- [x] Summary report generation with key insights
- [x] Export to standard formats (CSV, Polars DataFrame)
- [x] Comparison capability against reference/benchmark data

## Deliverables
- `aqwa_result_extractor.py` — Bridge AQWARunResult → DiffractionResults via AQWAConverter
- `test_aqwa_result_extractor.py` — 11 tests (all passed)
- Reuses shared postprocessing: RAOPlotter, PolarsExporter, OutputValidator (from WRK-030)
- Registered in `__init__.py` exports
