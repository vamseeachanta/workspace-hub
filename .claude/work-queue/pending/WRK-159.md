# Three-Way Design Code Comparison Report

## What
Generate a side-by-side comparison report for the same pipe analyzed under API RP 1111, API RP 2RD (WSD), and API STD 2RD (LRFD). Shows how different codes yield different required wall thicknesses and utilization ratios.

## Why
- Client-facing deliverable demonstrating regulatory knowledge depth
- Common engineering question: "which code governs for my application?"
- All 3 codes already implemented — this is the integration/visualization layer

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comparison function: same pipe spec run through all 3 registered codes
- [ ] Tabular comparison: required t_min, utilization, governing condition per code
- [ ] HTML report with side-by-side charts
- [ ] At least 2 pipe configurations compared (shallow water pipeline, deepwater riser)
- [ ] Tests verify all 3 codes produce results for the same input
