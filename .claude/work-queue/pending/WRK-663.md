# analysis(workspace-hub): WRK Queue Triage — Classify 160+ Pending Items

## What

The pending queue has 160+ items. Many are old (>3 months), blocked by superseded
dependencies, or have `complexity` misclassified. Use Gemini to read the full
pending queue in one pass and output:
1. Items that are **stale** (dependency resolved, can unblock now)
2. Items that are **mislabelled** (complexity wrong vs. actual scope)
3. Items that are **duplicates** (same outcome, different framing)
4. Items that are **quick wins** (≤1h, high value, no blockers)
5. Items that should be **archived/cancelled** (superseded, personal, OrcaFlex-only)

Output is an actionable triage sheet — not implementation, just classification.

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Build queue snapshot (5 min)

```bash
cd /mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub

# Concatenate all pending WRK items (frontmatter + first 30 lines of body)
find .claude/work-queue/pending -name "WRK-*.md" | sort -t- -k2 -n | \
  xargs -I{} sh -c 'echo "=== {} ===" && head -50 {}' \
> /tmp/pending-queue-snapshot.txt

wc -l /tmp/pending-queue-snapshot.txt   # sanity check
```

```bash
cat /tmp/pending-queue-snapshot.txt | \
gemini -p "
You are triaging a software engineering work queue. For each WRK item:

QUICK-WIN: complexity=simple, no blockers, estimated <1h, clear acceptance criteria
STALE-BLOCKER: blocked_by refers to a WRK that sounds complete (done/archived)
MISCLASSIFIED: complexity field is clearly wrong (e.g., says simple but scope is large)
DUPLICATE: same outcome as another WRK in this list (note the pair)
CANCEL: personal errand, requires OrcaFlex license, or explicitly superseded
SKIP-MACHINE: requires ace-linux-2 or acma-ansys05 (not ace-linux-1)
OK: no issue found

Output as a markdown table:
| WRK-ID | Category | Reason (1 sentence) | Recommended Action |

Then add a PRIORITY TOP-10 section: the 10 highest-value, lowest-effort items that
are unblocked and ready to implement right now." -y \
> specs/wrk/WRK-663/queue-triage-report.md
```

### Phase 2 — Validate stale-blocker findings (10 min)

For each STALE-BLOCKER finding, check the referenced WRK file location:
```bash
while IFS= read -r wrk_id; do
  path=$(find .claude/work-queue -name "${wrk_id}.md" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  status=$(grep "^status:" "$path" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  echo "$wrk_id: $path — $status"
done < <(grep "STALE-BLOCKER" specs/wrk/WRK-663/queue-triage-report.md \
  | grep -oP 'WRK-\d+')
```

### Phase 3 — Act on top recommendations (20 min)

- **CANCEL items**: update status and move to `done/` with a cancel note
- **STALE-BLOCKER items**: remove the resolved `blocked_by` entries and move to `pending/`
- **QUICK-WIN items**: re-order in INDEX with `priority: high`
- **DUPLICATE items**: add a `related:` cross-reference and note in the superseding item

### Phase 4 — Regenerate INDEX (2 min)

```bash
python3 .claude/work-queue/scripts/generate-index.py
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `specs/wrk/WRK-663/queue-triage-report.md` with classification table for
  all 160+ pending items
- [ ] PRIORITY TOP-10 section identifies unblocked, high-value items
- [ ] STALE-BLOCKER items validated — at least 5 items unblocked
- [ ] CANCEL items (personal/OrcaFlex/superseded) moved to `done/` with note
- [ ] INDEX regenerated after all moves
- [ ] Net pending queue reduced by ≥10 items

## Why

A 160-item queue is unmanageable without classification. Gemini's 1M context can hold
all 160 item summaries simultaneously and reason about cross-item dependencies and
duplicates that per-item review misses. The triage output feeds directly into the next
session's `/work run` prioritization.

## Agentic AI Horizon

High fit: pure read + classify, no code changes. Gemini excels at bulk document
classification with consistent criteria across many items. Output drives immediate
queue improvement with zero risk (analysis only until Phase 3 edits are approved).
