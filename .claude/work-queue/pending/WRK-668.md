# feat(work-queue): Archive Tooling Contract and Auto Spin-off Workflow

## What

Define and implement explicit archive-stage tooling requirements, including detection of missing capabilities and deterministic creation of follow-on WRKs when archive blockers require non-trivial remediation.

## Why

User gap review on WRK-624 requested revision on Archive: identify required tooling and spin additional work items as required.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define a canonical archive-tooling requirement matrix (validator, merge/sync evidence, legal scan, HTML verification, document-index hooks)
- [ ] Add machine-checkable archive evidence schema with required and optional fields
- [ ] Add validator enforcement for archive-tooling readiness and evidence completeness
- [ ] Implement spin-off rule:
  - [ ] if archive blocker is deep/non-trivial, auto-create a pending WRK with context, owner recommendation, and required workstation(s)
- [ ] Add HTML “Archive Readiness” section with pass/fail and spin-off recommendations
- [ ] Add 3 realistic test scenarios (pass, soft-fail with workaround, hard-fail with spin-off)
- [ ] Cross-review with Claude, Codex, Gemini and synthesize verdict

## Notes

- This is a direct follow-on from WRK-624 user gap decision (`archive: revise`).
- Keep archive deterministic: no silent bypasses, no ambiguous readiness state.
