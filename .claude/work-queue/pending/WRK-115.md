# Link RAO Data to Hull Shapes in Hull Library Catalog

## What
Add RAO (Response Amplitude Operator) linkage to hull shapes in the hull library catalog. Each hull entry should be able to reference associated RAO datasets that accumulate over time as diffraction analyses are performed. When a new diffraction analysis produces RAOs for a cataloged hull, the link is established automatically.

## Why
Hull panel meshes (WRK-114) and diffraction solver results (RAOs) are currently disconnected. Linking them creates a growing knowledge base: each hull gains a history of RAO results across different analysis conditions (wave headings, drafts, solver types). This enables rapid lookup of existing RAOs before re-running expensive diffraction analyses, and feeds into the parametric hull pipeline (WRK-043) and solver benchmarking (WRK-031).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PanelCatalogEntry schema extended with RAO reference field(s)
- [ ] RAO registry/index that maps hull_id → list of RAO datasets (solver, draft, date, file path)
- [ ] Hook or utility to register new RAO results against a hull after diffraction analysis
- [ ] Catalog YAML/CSV updated to include RAO link metadata
- [ ] HTML report updated to show RAO availability per hull
- [ ] Tests covering RAO linking, lookup, and catalog round-trip
