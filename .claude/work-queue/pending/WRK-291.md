# Install recommended FEA programs on ace-linux-2

## What

Based on the research findings from WRK-289, install the top recommended open source FEA
programs on ace-linux-2. Configure each for use with the core engineering suite (FreeCAD,
Gmsh, ParaView) and verify with a sample assignment-style problem.

## Why

FEA capability is essential for engineering assignments (structural analysis, heat transfer,
modal analysis). The specific programs to install depend on WRK-289 research results —
this item executes those recommendations.

## Dependency

**Blocked by WRK-289** — cannot proceed until FEA research report identifies top recommendations.

## Likely Candidates (from WRK-289 research scope)

These are probable picks based on open source FEA landscape — final selection from research:

- **CalculiX** — most likely pick for structural FEA (Abaqus-compatible)
- **Elmer FEM** or **Code_Aster** — for multiphysics / thermal
- **FEniCSx** — if Python-based FEA is preferred for assignments

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Top 3 recommended FEA programs from WRK-289 installed on ace-linux-2
- [ ] Each program integrated with Gmsh (mesh import) and ParaView (results export)
- [ ] At least one sample problem solved per program (e.g., cantilever beam, heat conduction)
- [ ] Installation steps added to setup script from WRK-290
- [ ] Known issues or workarounds documented

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Installation follows proven patterns from WRK-290 — extend the setup script
- Sample problems serve as future assignment templates
- Integration testing validates the capability map (WRK-292)
