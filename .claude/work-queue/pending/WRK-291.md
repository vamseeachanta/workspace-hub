# Install recommended FEA programs on ace-linux-2

## What

Based on the research findings from WRK-289, install the top recommended open source FEA
programs on ace-linux-2. Configure each for use with the core engineering suite (FreeCAD,
Gmsh, ParaView) and verify with a sample assignment-style problem.

## Why

FEA capability is essential for engineering assignments (structural analysis, heat transfer,
modal analysis). The specific programs to install depend on WRK-289 research results —
this item executes those recommendations.

## Dependency

**Blocked by WRK-289** — cannot proceed until FEA research report identifies top recommendations.

## Likely Candidates (from WRK-289 research scope)

These are probable picks based on open source FEA landscape — final selection from research:

- **CalculiX** — most likely pick for structural FEA (Abaqus-compatible)
- **Elmer FEM** or **Code_Aster** — for multiphysics / thermal
- **FEniCSx** — if Python-based FEA is preferred for assignments

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Top 3 recommended FEA programs from WRK-289 installed on ace-linux-1
- [x] Each program integrated with Gmsh (mesh import) and ParaView (results export)
- [x] At least one sample problem solved per program (cantilever beam + heat conduction)
- [x] Installation steps added to setup script from WRK-290
- [x] Known issues or workarounds documented

## Installation Results (ace-linux-1, 2026-02-24)

**Note:** WRK-291 title says ace-linux-2 but computer field = ace-linux-1. Work done on ace-linux-1.
No root/sudo available on ace-linux-1 — used user-space installation strategy.

| Program | Version | Method | Smoke Test |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| **CalculiX CCX** | 2.21 | .deb extracted → `~/.local/bin/ccx` | Cantilever beam: Uy = -0.177mm ✓ |
| **CalculiX CGX** | 2.21 | .deb extracted → `~/.local/bin/cgx` | Installed (GUI needs X display) |
| **Elmer FEM** | 26.1 (2026-02-24) | Source build w/ miniforge3 compilers | Heat plate: 293–373 K linear ✓ |
| **FEniCSx** | 0.10.0 | conda-forge (miniforge3 env) | Heat plate: 293–373 K, mean 333 K ✓ |
| **Gmsh** | 4.15.1 | pip --user --break-system-packages | 190 nodes, 433 tet elements ✓ |
| **Miniforge3** | conda 26.1.0 | user-space (no root) | Base for FEniCSx + Elmer compilers |
| **ccx2paraview** | 3.2.0 | pip | VTK export from CCX .frd ✓ |
| **pycalculix** | 1.1.4 | pip | Python wrapper for CCX |
| **meshio** | 5.3.5 | pip | Mesh format conversion |
| **pyvista** | 0.47.1 | pip | Python visualization |

## Integration Verified

- **Gmsh → CalculiX**: Export .inp format, run CCX, convert .frd → .vtk with ccx2paraview
- **Gmsh → Elmer**: `ElmerGrid 14 2 mesh.msh` converts to Elmer format, ElmerSolver runs
- **FEniCSx + Gmsh**: `dolfinx.io.gmshio` for mesh import in Python scripts
- **Results → ParaView**: VTK (CCX), VTU (Elmer), XDMF/pyvista (FEniCSx)

## Files Added / Modified

- `docs/ops/fea-install-ace-linux-1.md` — full installation log with known issues
- `scripts/setup/engineering-suite-install.sh` — updated verify() and header comments
- `scripts/setup/fea-pkgs/` — downloaded .deb packages for CalculiX user-space deps
- `~/.local/bin/ccx`, `ElmerSolver`, `ElmerGrid`, `fenicsx-python` — wrapper scripts
- `~/.local/lib/fea-libs/` — CalculiX shared library dependencies
- `~/.local/elmer/` — Elmer FEM installed here
- `~/miniforge3/` — Miniforge3 + fenicsx-env conda environment
- `~/.bashrc` — ELMER_HOME, PATH for miniforge3

## Known Issues / Workarounds

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|-----------|
| No root/sudo on ace-linux-1 | All installs in user space; .deb extract for CalculiX |
| CalculiX apt version is 2.21 (not 2.23) | Functional for assignments; upgrade via conda-forge when root available |
| Elmer PPA needs root | Built from source with miniforge3 GCC 15.2 — actually newer than PPA |
| FEniCSx not on PyPI | conda-forge via miniforge3 (no root needed) |
| FEniCSx 0.10.0 API change | `LinearProblem` requires `petsc_options_prefix` kwarg |
| CGX needs X display | Use FreeCAD FEM workbench or command-line workflow |

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Installation follows proven patterns from WRK-290 — extend the setup script
- Sample problems serve as future assignment templates
- Integration testing validates the capability map (WRK-292)
