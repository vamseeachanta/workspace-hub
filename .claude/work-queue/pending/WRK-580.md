# Map Open-Access Journal Portfolio for Engineering Domains

## What

Use the DOAJ API (doaj.org/api/), CORE.ac.uk API, and OpenAIRE API to
enumerate all fully open-access journals relevant to the workspace-hub
module set. Cross-reference with the WRK-383 module list.

## Why

Multiple fully OA offshore/marine journals were discovered (IJNAOE, IJCOE,
JMSE, JOES, JNAME) that are free to read with no subscription. A systematic
mapping enables agents to retrieve authoritative full-text references.

## Deliverables

- Per-module OA journal registry (YAML or JSON)
- Cross-reference with WRK-383 module gap analysis
- DOAJ API query skill or script

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] DOAJ API queried by engineering subject keywords
- [ ] Cross-referenced with WRK-383 module list
- [ ] Per-module journal registry produced
- [ ] At least 10 OA journals identified and catalogued
- [ ] Output integrated into `specs/online-resources/`
