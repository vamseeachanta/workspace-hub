# feat(calculations): implement Miller, J.E., et al, 1985 - Influence...

## Standard
- **ID**: Miller, J.E., et al, 1985 - Influence of Mud Column dynamic
- **Title**: Miller, J.E., et al, 1985   Influence of Mud Column dynamic
- **Org**: Offshore Technology Conference
- **Document**: `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/MIL/Miller,_J.E.,_et_al,_1985_-_Influence_of_Mud_Column_dynamic.pdf` (SHA: `8b07d80c473ffb6a...`)

- **Discipline**: marine

## Target Module
- **Repo**: assetutilities
- **Module**: `calculations`
- **Current status**: gap (no implementation found)
- **Capability tier target**: Tier 1 (deterministic calculation)

## What to Implement
This paper investigates the impact of mud column compressibility on the dynamic top tension of suspended deepwater drilling risers during storm hang-off conditions. It demonstrates that treating the mud column as a rigid lumped mass can lead to non-conservative errors, especially for risers exceeding 2000 feet in length. The study proposes a discrete spring-mass model to better account for flui...

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Function implements Miller, J.E., et al, 1985 - Influence... calculation
- [ ] Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases
- [ ] Result validated against worked example in standard (if available)
- [ ] Module registry updated: status → implemented

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Standards implementation is direct engineering value: agents can invoke
  Miller, J.E., et al, 1985 - Influence... calculations in automated workflows
- **Disposition: invest now** — engineering standards code is foundational
  and non-perishable
