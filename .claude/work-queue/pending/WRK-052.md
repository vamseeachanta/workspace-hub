# assetutilities Test Coverage Improvement

## What
Improve test coverage for the assetutilities repository from the current 21% to 80%+. The repo has 11K statements and 2684 test files, but several key packages have zero coverage.

## Why
At 21% coverage, critical utility packages used across multiple projects have no regression protection. Zero-coverage packages like excel_utilities, pdf_utilities, devtools, reportgen, and validators are particularly risky as they handle data I/O and validation.

## Current State
- **Coverage**: 21%
- **Statements**: ~11K
- **Test files**: 2684
- **Zero-coverage packages**: excel_utilities, pdf_utilities, devtools, reportgen, validators

## Strategy
1. Focus on zero-coverage packages first: excel_utilities, pdf_utilities, devtools, reportgen, validators
2. Write tests for public API surfaces of each package
3. Add edge case and error handling tests
4. Increase coverage incrementally per package

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] excel_utilities package coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] pdf_utilities package coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] devtools package coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] reportgen package coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] validators package coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] Overall repository coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] CI pipeline reports coverage on every PR

## Notes
- Zero-coverage packages should be highest priority as they represent the largest risk
- Some packages may need test fixtures (sample Excel/PDF files) for proper testing
