# Canada Offshore + Emerging Basin Watch List

## Two Parts

### Part A — Canada C-NLOER Offshore Production Data (worldenergydata)

**Rationale:** Newfoundland & Labrador offshore is a small but well-documented
conventional deepwater basin (Jeanne d'Arc sub-basin, water depths 80-100m).
C-NLOER (formerly CNLOPB) publishes field-level monthly production statistics
publicly. Good analogue for mature conventional offshore compared against
younger pre-salt (Brazil) and NCS tiebacks.

**Data source:** `https://www.cnlopb.ca/information/statistics/`
- Monthly production by field (Hibernia, Hebron, Terra Nova, White Rose, North Amethyst)
- Historical from 1997 to present
- HTML table / CSV download format; no API but well-structured
- Terra Nova restarted 2023 after 4-year hiatus — useful restart/ramp-up data

**Fields of interest:**

| Field | Operator | Type | Status |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
| Hibernia | ExxonMobil (33.1%) | Concrete GBS platform | Producing since 1997 |
| Hebron | ExxonMobil (35.5%) | Concrete GBS | Producing since 2017 |
| Terra Nova | Suncor (37.7%) | FPSO | Restarted 2023 |
| White Rose / North Amethyst | Cenovus (72.5%) | FPSO | Producing |

**Module:** `worldenergydata/canada_offshore/` (mirrors NCS/UKCS pattern)

### Part B — Emerging Basin Watch List (digitalmodel reference + worldenergydata stubs)

Four basins are the global field development hot spots for 2025-2028 but have
**no granular open production data today**. They need a structured watch
mechanism so worldenergydata can integrate them when data becomes available.

**Strategy per basin:**

#### Guyana — Stabroek Block
- **Status:** ~900,000 bopd across 4 FPSOs (Liza Destiny, Liza Unity, Prosperity, Yellowtail)
  as of Nov 2025; Hammerhead FID 2025 (first oil ~2029)
- **Data availability:** None at field/well level. Country-level via EIA. EITI reports
  with ~18 month lag are the only structured pathway.
- **Action:** Create stub `worldenergydata/guyana/` with EIA country series + EITI
  report parser stub. Add case studies to WRK-191 catalog:
  Yellowtail (250,000 bopd, FPSO, 2024 start), Liza Phase 2 (220,000 bopd, 2022 start)
- **Monitor trigger:** When Guyana EPA / Ministry of Natural Resources publishes
  structured production data or joins EITI as fully compliant member

#### Suriname — Block 58 (GranMorgu)
- **Status:** FID Oct 2024, TotalEnergies (50%) + APA (50%), ~$10.5B, 220,000 bopd
  FPSO, first oil 2028
- **Data availability:** Staatsolie annual reports (PDF); no well/field data
- **Action:** Add GranMorgu to WRK-191 catalog (pre-production reference).
  Create stub for post-2028 integration.
- **Monitor trigger:** First oil (est. 2028); check if Staatsolie joins EITI

#### Namibia — Orange Basin
- **Status:** Venus (TotalEnergies, 5.1 Bbbl in-place, FID deferred to 2026);
  Mopane (Galp + TotalEnergies, pre-FID). No production yet.
- **Data availability:** None. NAMCOR has no open data portal. EITI accession not yet.
- **Action:** Add Venus and Mopane to WRK-191 catalog as pre-FID reference entries.
  Monitor for NAMCOR data portal or EITI application.
- **Monitor trigger:** TotalEnergies Venus FID (expected 2026)

#### Falkland Islands — Sea Lion
- **Status:** FID Dec 2025, Navitas Petroleum (65%), 315 MMbbl recoverable,
  50,000 bopd, first oil ~2028
- **Data availability:** Falkland Islands Government (FIG) / FOGL. Small regulator;
  unclear if field-level data will be public.
- **Action:** Add Sea Lion to WRK-191 catalog. Monitor FIG for production reporting
  framework as first oil approaches.
- **Monitor trigger:** FIG petroleum regulator data portal (establish ~2027)
