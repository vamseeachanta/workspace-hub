# Research and prototype Gmsh Python API for automated hull mesh generation

## What

Research the Gmsh Python API (`import gmsh`) and build `agents/mesh_agent.py` — a prototype that takes a hull STEP file (exported from FreeCAD or pythonOCC) and produces a quality surface/volume mesh ready for FEA solvers (CalculiX, FEniCS, Elmer). Focus on a single hull geometry as proof of concept.

## Why

Gmsh is available on ace-linux-2, is fully scriptable via Python (`pip install gmsh`), and outputs `.msh` format readable by all open-source FEA solvers. Automating mesh generation is the critical bridge between CAD geometry (Stage 1) and FEA solving (Stage 3) in the pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Research note at `docs/research/gmsh-hull-meshing.md`: Gmsh Python API capabilities, mesh size strategies for curved hull surfaces, quality metrics
- [ ] `agents/mesh_agent.py` with `mesh_from_step(step_path, output_path, mesh_size=0.05) -> dict` — returns mesh quality stats
- [ ] Proof-of-concept: mesh at least one hull geometry from `geometry/hull/` exported to STEP
- [ ] Output: `.msh` file with surface + optional volume mesh; mesh quality report (element count, min/max aspect ratio, skewness)
- [ ] Mesh size parameters configurable via YAML (`specs/mesh_config.yaml`)
- [ ] 5+ tests in `tests/test_mesh_agent.py` (mock STEP input)
- [ ] Pushed to `bakkiprasad5669/CAD-DEVELOPMENTS`

## Research Questions

1. What Gmsh meshing algorithm works best for curved hull surfaces (BRep from OCC)?
2. Can Gmsh directly open FreeCAD `.FCStd` files via its OCC kernel, or must we export to STEP first?
3. What mesh size produces a quality mesh for structural FEA on a small hull (L~5m)?
4. How to handle watertight hull solid vs. surface-only shell meshing?

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Automated mesh generation removes the last manual step in the CAD→FEA pipeline
- AI can tune mesh size based on analysis type (coarse for global loads, fine for stress concentration)
- Gmsh supports adaptive refinement — future agents can run mesh convergence studies automatically
