# Passing Ship Analysis for Moored Vessels

## What
Build a passing ship analysis capability for moored vessels. Calculate hydrodynamic forces on a moored vessel due to a passing ship (surge, sway, yaw), evaluate mooring line tensions under passing ship events, and generate standardized reports. Covers perpendicular and parallel passing cases, with/without wind, at varying speeds and distances.

## Why
- Passing ship effects are a critical design case for port/terminal mooring systems
- ~15+ historical projects demonstrate recurring demand for this analysis type
- Currently relies on standalone Excel tool (`PassingShipForceCalculator.xlsm`) and manual AQWA runs
- Standardizing into the digitalmodel framework enables parametric studies, consistent reporting, and reuse

## Resources (local, not in repo)
- **Tool**: `G:\ACMA Tool\Passing Ships\` — existing passing ship force calculator (Excel-based)
- **Archive**: `R:\Archive - Drive J\` — ~15+ past project folders with AQWA models, reports, and results
- **Key tool files**: `PassingShipForceCalculator.xlsm` (force calculation), `PassingShipForceCalculator 3.7 knot.xlsm` (speed variant)
- **Output examples**: Line tension plots at various passing speeds (3.0 knot, 3.7 knot), mooring line groups (1-6, 7-12)

## Technical Scope
1. **Passing ship force model** — hydrodynamic interaction forces (surge, sway, yaw) as function of:
   - Passing ship speed, size (displacement, length, beam, draft)
   - Moored vessel dimensions
   - Separation distance (lateral)
   - Water depth / depth-to-draft ratio
   - Passing angle (parallel, perpendicular, oblique)
2. **Mooring response** — time-domain mooring analysis with passing ship force time history:
   - Line tensions per mooring line
   - Vessel motions (surge, sway, yaw excursions)
   - Fender loads
   - Combined with wind, current, wave (with/without passing vessel scenarios)
3. **Analysis cases** — parametric matrix:
   - Wind with passing vessel / wind without passing vessel
   - Perpendicular passing / parallel passing
   - Multiple passing speeds
   - Short ship / long ship variants
4. **PassingShipForceCalculator extraction** — reverse-engineer the Excel tool logic into Python
5. **AQWA integration** — passing ship force application in AQWA mooring analysis (or OrcaFlex equivalent)
6. **Reporting** — standardized HTML report per WRK-129 convention

## PassingShipSpec — Analysis Specification
Create a `PassingShipSpec` (similar to `DiffractionSpec` pattern) that fully defines a passing ship analysis:
- **Moored vessel**: hull geometry, mooring arrangement, loading condition, RAOs
- **Passing ship**: type, displacement, LOA, beam, draft, speed, track (distance, angle)
- **Environment**: water depth, wind speed/direction, current, wave conditions
- **Analysis matrix**: cases (with/without wind, with/without passing, speeds, angles)
- **Output requests**: line tensions, vessel motions, fender loads, force time histories
- Spec format: YAML (`spec.yml`), validated by Pydantic schema, drives automated analysis pipeline

## Benchmarking — 5-7 Historical Projects
Reproduce 5-7 past passing ship projects from `R:\Archive - Drive J\` to validate the new implementation:
1. Extract original analysis inputs (vessel data, mooring layout, passing ship parameters, environmental conditions)
2. Sanitize all client/project references per legal compliance
3. Create `spec.yml` for each benchmark case
4. Run through new Python pipeline
5. Compare results against original project outputs (line tensions, vessel motions)
6. Acceptance: within 5% of original results for line tensions, 10% for vessel motions

Target benchmark set (select 5-7 from ~15 archived projects covering diverse scenarios):
- At least 1 perpendicular passing case
- At least 1 parallel passing case
- At least 1 with wind + passing vessel combined
- At least 1 port/dock berth configuration
- At least 1 open water / VLCC terminal configuration
- Range of passing speeds (2-5 knots)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `PassingShipSpec` Pydantic schema defined and validated
- [ ] Passing ship force calculation implemented in Python (from Excel tool extraction)
- [ ] Force time history generation for given passing scenario (speed, distance, ship size)
- [ ] Mooring response analysis with passing ship forces (line tensions, motions)
- [ ] Parametric study capability (speed × distance × wind × passing angle matrix)
- [ ] 5-7 benchmark cases reproduced from historical projects, results within tolerance
- [ ] Each benchmark has sanitized `spec.yml` in `docs/modules/orcaflex/passing_ship/`
- [ ] Standardized HTML report with force plots, tension envelopes, motion time histories
- [ ] Integration with existing hydrodynamics module
