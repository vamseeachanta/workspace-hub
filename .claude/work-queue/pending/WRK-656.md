# fix(review): Enforce Orchestrator Gate Evidence Contract

## Problem

CLAUDE.md rule #1 says Claude orchestrators must orchestrate, not execute, yet the workflow lacks
machine-checkable evidence that each stage gate (WRK gate, plan gate, cross-review gate, TDD gate,
Legal scan) has completed before moving forward. Codex points to this gap as the high-value follow-on.

## What

Deliver a validator-ready evidence contract that any orchestrator (starting with Claude) must satisfy before
claiming implementation. Evidence must be explicit, stored, and verifiable.

Scope:

1. define artifact checklist for each gate that the orchestrator must record (WRK metadata, Plan HTML review log,
   cross-review verdicts, test run manifest, legal scan status)
2. store evidence in a validator-friendly location (`assets/WRK-<id>/claim-evidence.yaml` or similar) for each gate and publish a reusable template that lists the required fields
3. provide tooling or scripts that read the evidence pack (per the template) and fail fast if a gate result is missing or `NO_OUTPUT`
4. document how future orchestrators (Claude, Codex, Gemini) can reuse the contract

## Why

- avoids skipping plan approvals or treating fallbacks as passes under pressure
- gives cross-review real data points to cite when an orchestrator claims progress
- aligns with Codex recommendation to pick this item if only one follow-on is funded

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Evidence definition

- list required artifacts for each gate plus acceptable verdicts
- choose storage conventions (YAML manifest, metadata fields, `cross-review.log` updates)

### Phase 2 — Validator tooling

- ship `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py` that reads the evidence pack (per the template),
  enforces gate sequence (plan, cross-review, tests, legal), and fails when required entries are missing or `NO_OUTPUT`
- add a review section in `.claude/docs/orchestrator-gate-contract.md` describing how orchestrators must call/record this script before claiming

### Phase 3 — Documentation/examples

- document the contract in `.claude/docs/orchestrator-gate-contract.md`
- provide an example evidence pack generated while claiming WRK-624 (or WRK-655) to show compliance using the template

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Gate artifacts and verdict enumerations are defined and published via `.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-656/claim-evidence-template.yaml`
- [ ] `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py` exercises the template and fails when evidence is missing or marked `NO_OUTPUT`
- [ ] `.claude/docs/orchestrator-gate-contract.md` explains how any orchestrator can satisfy the contract and run the validator
- [ ] Example gate evidence pack exists for a recent WRK (WRK-624 / WRK-655)

## Evidence
- `assets/WRK-XXXX/claim-evidence.yaml` for each gate plus the template at `assets/WRK-656/claim-evidence-template.yaml`
- `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py` invocation log
- `.claude/docs/orchestrator-gate-contract.md` update referencing the validator

## Outcome

Orchestrators produce repeatable, validator-friendly evidence of all gate completions, eliminating skip pressure and giving Codex/Cross-Review a trustable audit trail.
