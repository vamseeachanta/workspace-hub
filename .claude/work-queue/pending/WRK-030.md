# OrcaWave Batch Analysis + Postprocessing

## What
Enable batch execution of OrcaWave runs and build a postprocessing pipeline. Extract RAOs, generate verification plots, and produce insight reports. Mirror the AQWA batch/postprocessing capabilities for consistency.

## Why
Same rationale as AQWA batch/postprocessing — diffraction analysis requires many runs and structured results extraction. Consistent interfaces between AQWA and OrcaWave postprocessing enable the benchmark comparison (WRK-031).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Batch job definition and execution for OrcaWave
- [ ] Sequential and parallel execution modes
- [ ] Parse OrcaWave output files
- [ ] Extract RAOs for all 6 DOFs
- [ ] Generate RAO plots (amplitude + phase)
- [ ] Verification checks (symmetry, limits, resonance)
- [ ] Summary report with key insights
- [ ] Export to standard formats (CSV, Polars DataFrame)
- [ ] Consistent output format with AQWA postprocessing for benchmarking
