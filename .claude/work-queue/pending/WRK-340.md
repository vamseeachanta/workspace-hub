# Composite panel design tool — Classical Laminate Theory CLT strength checks

## What

Implement composite panel design using Classical Laminate Theory (CLT). Ply-by-ply
stress/strain, laminate stiffness matrix (ABD), first-ply failure prediction (Tsai-Wu, max
strain). For GRP/CFRP structural panels in marine and offshore applications.

## Why

Composite materials (GRP, CFRP) are increasingly used in offshore structures for weight
reduction and corrosion resistance. CLT is the fundamental analytical method for composite
laminate design. Having a CLT implementation in acma-projects enables rapid laminate sizing
and strength verification without FEA for preliminary design stages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Ply property input: E1, E2, G12, nu12, thickness, orientation for each ply
- [ ] Laminate stiffness matrix: A (extensional), B (coupling), D (bending) matrices
- [ ] Ply-by-ply stress and strain calculation under applied loads (Nx, Ny, Nxy, Mx, My, Mxy)
- [ ] Failure prediction: Tsai-Wu criterion
- [ ] Failure prediction: Maximum strain criterion
- [ ] Failure prediction: Maximum stress criterion
- [ ] First-ply failure identification: which ply fails first, at what load fraction
- [ ] Material library: E-glass/polyester, E-glass/epoxy, carbon/epoxy (standard properties)
- [ ] Pytest coverage with textbook example verifications (Jones, Daniel & Ishai)
