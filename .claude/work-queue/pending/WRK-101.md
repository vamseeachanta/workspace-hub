# Add Mesh Decimation/Coarsening to Mesh-Utilities

## What
Implement proper mesh decimation using either:
1. VTK's `vtkQuadricClustering` via PyVista
2. GMSH remeshing with larger element size
3. Custom vertex clustering algorithm

Currently only simple panel-skip coarsening is available.

## Why
The mesh-utilities skill needs robust coarsening for:
- Quick preliminary solver runs with reduced mesh
- Convergence studies (varying panel count)
- Reducing overly-detailed CAD exports

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement at least one robust decimation method
- [ ] Preserve mesh topology (no holes introduced)
- [ ] Preserve quality (aspect ratio not degraded significantly)
- [ ] Add `coarsen_mesh()` function to mesh-utilities skill
- [ ] Test: reduce 5000-panel mesh to 500 panels with quality check
- [ ] Update skill documentation with usage examples
