- **Discipline**: marine

## Target Module
- **Repo**: assetutilities
- **Module**: `calculations`
- **Current status**: gap (no implementation found)
- **Capability tier target**: Tier 1 (deterministic calculation)

## What to Implement
This paper addresses concerns that current pipeline codes result in overly conservative designs for high-pressure subsea flowlines and steel catenary risers. It highlights the limitations of the traditional Barlow formula for thick-walled pipe and the resulting economic penalties in deepwater projects. It advocates for a shift toward limit state design based on actual burst strength to achieve ...

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Function implements OTC1997-8494 Code Conflicts calculation
- [ ] Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases
- [ ] Result validated against worked example in standard (if available)
- [ ] Module registry updated: status → implemented

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Standards implementation is direct engineering value: agents can invoke
  OTC1997-8494 Code Conflicts calculations in automated workflows
- **Disposition: invest now** — engineering standards code is foundational
  and non-perishable
