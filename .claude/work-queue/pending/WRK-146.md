# Overhaul aceengineer-website: Fix Positioning, Narrative, and Social Proof

## What
Complete content and positioning overhaul of aceengineer-website based on detailed external feedback. The site has a **positioning problem** — strong engineering substance but generic consulting packaging that undersells the actual story: one senior engineer + AI automation delivering at the scale of a team.

## Why
The site currently reads like a generic automation consultancy. The real differentiator — a 15+ year offshore engineer who built 700+ Python modules and now uses AI orchestration to outperform teams — is completely absent. This positioning gap is directly impacting business development.

## Feedback Summary (6 Issues)

### 1. Generic consulting voice
- Tagline "Engineering automation that transforms weeks of manual work into hours" could be any firm
- Nothing signals the unique solo-engineer + AI-powered stack model
- **Fix**: Lead with "One senior engineer + AI automation delivers what used to require a team"

### 2. About page is almost empty
- Four sentences from 2010
- No mention of credentials, years of experience, 700+ modules, AI orchestration
- **Fix**: Rewrite around Vamsee's story: decades of offshore engineering → built 700+ Python modules → AI-augmented to deliver at scale

### 3. Case studies feel templated
- Numbers (85%, 90%, 70% time reduction) without narrative
- No story of how work was done, what went wrong, what clients said
- **Fix**: Make case studies narrative — real problems, real process, real outcomes

### 4. Blog is strong but disconnected
- 12+ deep technical articles demonstrating serious authority
- Sitting in separate section instead of being the sales pitch
- **Fix**: Lead with blog content — technical depth IS the credibility. Link from services pages.

### 5. Pricing table unsupported
- Shows 60-70% savings but no social proof backing claims
- No client logos, testimonials, or linked case studies
- **Fix**: Add proof — standards bodies, operator types worked with, link case studies to pricing claims

### 6. No personality
- Site could belong to 50-person firm or solo practitioner
- The solo + AI story is the most compelling in the market right now
- **Fix**: Say the quiet part loud — own the solo-engineer-plus-AI positioning

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Homepage messaging rewritten: unique value proposition front and center
- [ ] About page rewritten with Vamsee's full story (experience, modules, AI stack)
- [ ] At least 2 case studies rewritten as narratives (problem → process → outcome)
- [ ] Blog articles surfaced/linked from services and homepage
- [ ] Pricing claims linked to supporting case studies
- [ ] Consistent "solo engineer + AI" positioning throughout
- [ ] Social proof section added (standards bodies, industry experience, project types)
- [ ] Site passes visual review — no broken layouts from content changes

## Strategic Positioning (from Feb 15-16 strategy session)

### Core Positioning Decision
Position A&CE as **"AI-native engineering insights & analytics for offshore energy"** (a FIRM with a capability), not "Vamsee the AI-native engineer" (a PERSON with skills).

**Rationale:**
- Clients buy from firms, not freelancers — easier to justify $120K retainers to procurement
- Eliminates key-man risk perception, even while Vamsee IS the operation
- Acquirers pay more for "company with IP" than "talented individual to hire"
- Comparable companies (Cognite, Akselos) all positioned as platforms/firms

### Headline Positioning
**"AI-native offshore engineering analytics"** — not "automation consultancy"

### The Sequence
- **Phase 1 (now):** Firm positioning + win 3-5 paying clients. Revenue is oxygen.
- **Phase 2 (parallel):** Build Vamsee's personal brand as expert BEHIND A&CE. Blog, conferences, LinkedIn — all attributed to "Vamsee at A&CE."
- **Sell the firm. Promote the founder.**

### Comparable Companies
- **Cognite** — Industrial data platform, $225M raised, acquired by Aker. Domain expertise + software → platform positioning.
- **Akselos** — Structural performance management, $16.5M raised. "1,000x faster, 10x more accurate."
- **Palantir** — Framed as analytics platform (tech multiples) even though heavily services-dependent.

### Key Numbers for Website
- 704+ production Python modules
- 221 S-N fatigue curves from 17 international standards
- 15+ years offshore engineering experience
- OrcaFlex/AQWA batch automation
- AI orchestration layer (Claude Code + sub-agents)

*Source: External feedback from detailed site review + A&CE strategy session Feb 15-16. "You have a positioning problem, not a product problem. The engineering work is genuinely strong. But the site currently says 'we're an automation consultancy' when it should say 'I'm a 15+ year offshore engineer who built an AI-powered engineering machine that outperforms teams of 10.'"*
