# OpenFOAM CFD analysis capability for digitalmodel

## What
Develop OpenFOAM CFD analysis capability within digitalmodel — tooling for setting up, running, and post-processing CFD simulations using OpenFOAM for marine/offshore engineering applications.

## Why
CFD analysis using OpenFOAM complements potential flow tools (OrcaWave, AQWA) by resolving viscous effects, wave-structure interaction, green water, sloshing, and other nonlinear phenomena. Having an integrated OpenFOAM workflow in digitalmodel enables higher-fidelity analysis where needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OpenFOAM case setup tooling (mesh generation, boundary conditions, solver selection)
- [ ] Pre-processing: geometry import, domain definition, mesh control
- [ ] Solver configuration for relevant marine/offshore applications
- [ ] Post-processing: results extraction, visualisation, force/pressure integration
- [ ] Parametric case generation (varying geometry, flow conditions, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with digitalmodel workflow and data structures
- [ ] Tests covering case setup and post-processing pipelines
- [ ] Documentation of supported analysis types and workflow
