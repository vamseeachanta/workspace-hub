# Soil Models & Shared Types (Phase 1)

## What

Create the foundation layer for the geotechnical module: soil profile data
models, CPT correlation methods, undrained shear strength profiles, cyclic
degradation, and parsers for GEF/AGS4/YAML soil data formats.

## Why

All subsequent geotechnical phases (piles, foundations, anchors, OBS, scour)
depend on a common soil profile representation and soil parameter derivation
from CPT data. This must be built first.

## Scope

### Packages
- pygef (MIT) — direct dependency for GEF file parsing
- python-AGS4 (LGPL-3.0) — direct dependency for AGS4 file parsing

### Standards
- API RP 2GEO (soil characterisation)
- DNV-RP-C212 (soil mechanics)

## Deliverables

- `geotechnical/soil_models/models.py` — SoilProfile, SoilLayer, CPTData, SoilType dataclasses
- `geotechnical/soil_models/su_profile.py` — undrained shear strength profile
- `geotechnical/soil_models/cpt_correlation.py` — Robertson (1990/2009) Ic, Qt, su/σ'
- `geotechnical/soil_models/cyclic_degradation.py` — cyclic strength ratio curves
- `geotechnical/parsers/gef_reader.py` — pygef wrapper
- `geotechnical/parsers/ags4_reader.py` — python-AGS4 wrapper
- `geotechnical/parsers/yaml_reader.py` — YAML soil profile loader
- Test suite validated against Robertson CPT classification tables

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SoilProfile, SoilLayer, CPTData, SoilType dataclasses with SI units
- [ ] Robertson (1990) CPT classification (Ic, Qt) matches published tables
- [ ] su/σ' correlation per API RP 2GEO Table 6.3.4-1
- [ ] Cyclic strength ratio curves for clay and sand
- [ ] GEF parser reads standard CPT files via pygef
- [ ] AGS4 parser reads borehole data via python-AGS4
- [ ] YAML parser loads layered soil profiles
- [ ] Tests validated against 2+ published worked examples
- [ ] Cross-review passes (Codex hard gate)
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Integration Points

- All Phase 2–6 children (WRK-619..623) consume SoilProfile
- OrcaFlex seabed models: SoilProfile → SeabedStiffness mapping
- Campaign soil variations derive from SoilProfile

## Source

Phase 1 of WRK-597 geotechnical module split.
