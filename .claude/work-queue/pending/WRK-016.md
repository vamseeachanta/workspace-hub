# BSEE completion and intervention activity analysis for insights

## What
Analyze BSEE well completion and intervention activity data to extract meaningful insights. This includes examining completion types, intervention frequencies, workover patterns, and their relationships to well age, field characteristics, water depth, and production performance. Identify trends, anomalies, and actionable patterns in how wells are completed and subsequently maintained.

## Why
Completion and intervention data reveals the lifecycle cost and operational burden of wells across the Gulf of Mexico. Understanding which completion strategies lead to fewer interventions, which fields have disproportionate workover rates, and what triggers intervention activity helps inform well design decisions and operational planning.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify and catalog BSEE completion and intervention datasets available
- [ ] Characterize completion types and their distribution across fields, water depths, and eras
- [ ] Analyze intervention activity: frequency, types (workover, sidetrack, plug-back, etc.), triggers
- [ ] Correlate intervention frequency with completion type, well age, and field characteristics
- [ ] Identify outlier wells/fields with unusually high or low intervention rates
- [ ] Find temporal trends in completion practices and intervention rates
- [ ] Produce summary insights with supporting visualizations
- [ ] Document methodology, data sources, and limitations
