# Set up remote desktop access on ace-linux-2

## What
Install and configure a remote desktop solution on ace-linux-2 so the machine can be accessed via GUI without physical KVM presence. Candidate options: x11vnc (share live session), xrdp (RDP protocol), or NoMachine.

## Why
KVM display drops when switching away (WRK-307). Remote desktop provides an alternative access path and reduces dependency on physical KVM switch for GUI work on ace-linux-2.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Remote desktop solution installed and running on ace-linux-2
- [x] Can connect from ace-linux-1 (LAN) — SSH tunnel + xtigervncviewer verified
- [~] Connection works over Tailscale (100.93.161.27) — requires SSH tunnel (x11vnc is localhost-bound); direct bind not configured
- [x] Service auto-starts on boot — `~/.config/autostart/x11vnc.desktop` present
- [x] Connection method documented in `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-02.md`

## Notes
- ace-linux-2 already has an Xorg session on `:1` (confirmed) — x11vnc is lowest-friction option
- Tailscale already configured (100.93.161.27/32)
- Related: WRK-307 (KVM display loss — EDID dongle fix)

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Low AI relevance — standard sysadmin task
- No reason to wait; straightforward install

## Completion Notes (WRK-352, 2026-02-24)

Installation and autostart were completed during WRK-307 (KVM display fix, 2026-02-23).
This WRK verified the setup via SSH and added documentation.

Verified live (SSH to ace-linux-2):
- x11vnc running: PID 244665, `x11vnc -display :1 -auth /run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority -forever -bg -nopw -listen localhost -rfbport 5900`
- Port 5900 confirmed LISTEN on 127.0.0.1 and [::] (localhost-bound)
- Autostart file present: `~/.config/autostart/x11vnc.desktop`

Note: x11vnc binds to localhost only (-listen localhost flag). Both LAN and
Tailscale access require an SSH tunnel. Direct Tailscale bind would require
changing the x11vnc startup flags to bind on the tailscale0 interface.
