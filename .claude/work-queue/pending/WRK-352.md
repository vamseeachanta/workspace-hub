# Set up remote desktop access on ace-linux-2

## What
Install and configure a remote desktop solution on ace-linux-2 so the machine can be accessed via GUI without physical KVM presence. Candidate options: x11vnc (share live session), xrdp (RDP protocol), or NoMachine.

## Why
KVM display drops when switching away (WRK-307). Remote desktop provides an alternative access path and reduces dependency on physical KVM switch for GUI work on ace-linux-2.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remote desktop solution installed and running on ace-linux-2
- [ ] Can connect from ace-linux-1 (LAN) and verify full desktop is accessible
- [ ] Connection works over Tailscale (100.93.161.27) for remote access
- [ ] Service auto-starts on boot (systemd unit enabled)
- [ ] Connection method documented in `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-02.md`

## Notes
- ace-linux-2 already has an Xorg session on `:1` (confirmed) — x11vnc is lowest-friction option
- Tailscale already configured (100.93.161.27/32)
- Related: WRK-307 (KVM display loss — EDID dongle fix)

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Low AI relevance — standard sysadmin task
- No reason to wait; straightforward install
