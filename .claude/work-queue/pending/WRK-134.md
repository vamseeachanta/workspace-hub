# Add Future-Work Brainstorming Step Before Archiving Completed Items

## What
Add a workflow step between item completion and archiving that identifies and brainstorms future work inspired by or enabled by the just-completed item. This captures follow-on opportunities while context is fresh.

## Why
Completed work items often reveal new opportunities, adjacent improvements, or downstream tasks. Currently these insights are lost once an item is archived. A structured brainstorming step ensures continuity and keeps the work queue fed with high-quality, context-rich items.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `on-complete-hook.sh` (or new pre-archive hook) prompts for future work identification
- [ ] Hook analyzes the completed item's scope, target repos, and related items to suggest follow-on work
- [ ] Suggested items can be auto-captured as new WRK items (pending user approval)
- [ ] process.md updated to document the new step between completion and archive
- [ ] SKILL.md updated with the new lifecycle step
