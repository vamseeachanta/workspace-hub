# Scour Prediction (Phase 6)

## What

Implement scour depth prediction for pipelines and offshore structures per
DNV-RP-F107, including scour protection (rock dumping) design.

## Why

Scour is a soil erosion phenomenon that affects pipelines, monopiles,
jackets, and gravity base structures. Not in the original WRK-597 scope
but identified as a gap during review. Located in `geotechnical/scour/`
because scour is fundamentally a soil erosion problem, not pipeline-specific.

## Scope

### Packages
- None — custom implementation

### Standards
- DNV-RP-F107 (Risk Assessment of Pipeline Protection)

## Deliverables

- `geotechnical/scour/pipeline_scour.py` — F107 pipeline scour depth
- `geotechnical/scour/structure_scour.py` — monopile/jacket leg scour
- `geotechnical/scour/scour_protection.py` — rock dumping design
- Test suite validated against Sumer & Fredsoe (2002) and DNV-RP-F107 examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pipeline scour depth prediction per DNV-RP-F107
- [ ] Monopile and jacket leg scour depth estimation
- [ ] Rock dumping scour protection sizing
- [ ] Tests validated against Sumer & Fredsoe (2002) and DNV-RP-F107 examples
- [ ] Cross-review passes (Codex hard gate)
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Integration Points

- **WRK-618** (Soil Models): scour depends on soil type and properties
- Monopile/jacket foundation design (future WRK items)

## Source

Phase 6 of WRK-597 geotechnical module split. New scope identified during
review — not in original WRK-597.
