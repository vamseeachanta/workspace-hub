# Integrate metocean data sources into unified aggregation interface

## What
Wire the 7 existing metocean data source clients (COOPS, ERDDAP, Met Norway, NDBC, OpenMeteo, etc.) into a single unified query interface with combined output. Currently they exist as independent clients with no aggregation layer.

## Why
Metocean data is part of the marketed data offering. Clients exist but are fragmented — no way to query "give me metocean data for location X" across all sources at once.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unified query interface accepting lat/lon and time range
- [ ] Automatically queries relevant clients based on location/coverage
- [ ] Combined output with source attribution
- [ ] Plotly visualization of combined metocean data
- [ ] CLI command for unified metocean query
- [ ] Tests with at least 2 real locations
