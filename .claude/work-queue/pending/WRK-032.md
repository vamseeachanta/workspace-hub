# Refactor OrcaFlex pipeline input to modular format with multi-pipeline support

## What
Refactor the OrcaFlex pipeline analysis input file in digitalmodel to have a modular section-based format (roller section, floating section) and support multiple pipelines with varying water depths, lengths, etc. for installation analysis. Include roller arrangement variations (different roller configurations, spacings, types) as a parametrisable section.

## Why
Current OrcaFlex pipeline input structure is monolithic and limited to a single pipeline configuration. Pipeline installation analysis in OrcaFlex requires modeling multiple pipeline scenarios with different water depths, lengths, and section types (roller, floating). A modular format enables reuse, clarity, and multi-pipeline batch analysis runs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OrcaFlex pipeline input file refactored into modular sections (roller section, floating section, etc.)
- [ ] Roller arrangement variations supported (different configurations, spacings, types)
- [ ] Each section has a clear, self-contained format
- [ ] Support for defining multiple pipelines in a single input configuration
- [ ] Each pipeline can specify independent water depths, lengths, and other OrcaFlex installation parameters
- [ ] Existing single-pipeline OrcaFlex workflows continue to work (backward compatibility)
- [ ] Input validation for the new modular format
- [ ] Tests covering multi-pipeline input parsing
- [ ] Documentation for the new OrcaFlex input file format
