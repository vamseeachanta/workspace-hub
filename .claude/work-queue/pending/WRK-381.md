# Trust Architecture Document — Plan Gate Governance for Agent Actions

## What

Write `docs/governance/TRUST-ARCHITECTURE.md` — a single document that formalises
the rules governing when an AI agent may act autonomously vs when it must pause for
human approval. This is the "trust architecture" referenced in `docs/vision/VISION.md`
as the bridge across the L3→L4 Trust Chasm.

The document covers:

1. **Action classification**: what categories of actions agents may take autonomously
   (read, analyse, generate draft output), require plan gate approval (commit, modify
   files, run solvers), or always escalate (publish, delete, send externally)
2. **Plan gate rules**: what constitutes a valid plan; required depth by route (A/B/C);
   who approves (user always for now; future: designated agent roles)
3. **Audit trail format**: what must be logged for every agent-executed action
   (who, what, when, WRK reference, outcome)
4. **Rollback rules**: what actions are reversible and how; what triggers automatic
   rollback vs human-confirmed rollback
5. **Escalation triggers**: conditions that must always surface to the human regardless
   of automation level (kick events in drilling, auth failures, cost thresholds)

## Why

`docs/vision/VISION.md` names the Trust Chasm as the hardest barrier between Level 3
and Level 4 autonomy. The plan gate, cross-review, WRK trail, and archival safety rule
already exist as practices — this document makes them explicit, legible, and referenceable
by agents and new contributors alike. Without it, the governance model exists only in
SKILL.md fragments and memory, not as a durable source of truth.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `docs/governance/TRUST-ARCHITECTURE.md` created (target: 600–800 words, table-heavy)
- [ ] Action classification table complete with ≥3 examples per tier
- [ ] Plan gate rules match the current work-queue SKILL.md exactly (no contradictions)
- [ ] Audit trail format defined with a concrete example log entry
- [ ] Rollback rules cover at least: git commits, file edits, solver runs
- [ ] Escalation triggers section covers: data deletion, external publishing, cost > threshold
- [ ] Document cross-referenced from `docs/vision/VISION.md` and work-queue `SKILL.md`

## Agentic AI Horizon

- This document is what allows L4 autonomy to be trusted: agents can act within the
  defined boundary without asking permission for every step
- Future agents can read this document to self-govern — "does this action require a plan
  gate?" becomes a lookup, not a judgement call
- The audit trail format becomes the input to the comprehensive-learning pipeline's
  governance quality signals
