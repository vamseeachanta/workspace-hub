# WRK-188: Wave-1 spec migration (worldenergydata)

## What
Execute a controlled Wave-1 migration for `worldenergydata/specs` into `specs/repos/worldenergydata/specs/` using a dry-run manifest first, then apply only after plan approval.

## Why
WRK-185 established migration governance. This WRK operationalizes the first bounded wave to validate safety controls before any large-corpus migration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dry-run manifest exists in `reports/compliance/` with source path, destination path, file count, and checksums.
- [ ] Plan cross-review completed and recorded.
- [ ] Claude workflow continuity check recorded: Claude confirms this wave can be executed without changing core WRK workflow gates.
- [ ] Apply run is blocked until explicit approval.
- [ ] Post-apply parity check command list is documented in spec.

## Plan
1. Produce migration dry-run log for `worldenergydata` only.
2. Produce pre-apply checksum manifest from source files.
3. Add apply checklist and rollback commands to spec.
4. Run cross-review on the WRK-188 spec.
5. Run Claude-specific workflow continuity check and attach result artifact.
5. Wait for approval before `--apply`.
