# Planing Hull Motion Model — Nonlinear 2D+t Strip Theory

## What

Implement a nonlinear planing hull heave-and-pitch motion model in
`src/digitalmodel/hydrodynamics/planing_hull/` based on the 2D+t strip theory
approach from Tavakoli et al. (2026), *Physics of Fluids* 38, 027129.

Reference PDF:
`docs/domains/hydrodynamics/literature/tavakoli-2026-planing-hull-dynamics-strip-theory-cfd.pdf`

The model covers:
- **2D+t formulation**: second-order Stokes wave kinematics + Wagner water-entry
  force per strip; each strip solved as a time-advancing 2D problem
- **Heave and pitch EOMs**: rigid-body coupled ODEs with time-varying added mass,
  lift, pitching moment, and cross-flow drag
- **Inputs**: hull geometry (Fridsma series or custom), Froude number, wave
  steepness `ε = kH/2`, wave frequency, heading (head seas)
- **Outputs**: heave RAO, pitch RAO, heave/pitch phase angles, 2nd-harmonic amplitudes

The CFD model (Section IV of the paper) is out of scope — the 2D+t model (Sections II–III)
is the target: low-cost, fast-to-run, good for parametric sweeps.

## Why

Planing hull analysis is directly relevant to ACE Engineering's fast-vessel and patrol-boat
client work. The 2D+t model is:
- An order of magnitude cheaper than CFD (minutes vs hours per run)
- Accurate for intermediate-to-long waves and moderate steepness
- Validated by the authors against towing tank data and CFD

This capability does not yet exist in digitalmodel (current hydrodynamics module handles
displacement ships via AQWA/OrcaFlex). Adding it enables rapid early-stage seakeeping
assessment for planing vessels without spinning up a full CFD solver.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `PlaningHullGeometry` dataclass: length L, beam B, deadrise β, chine height hc, LCG
- [x] `PlaningStripModel` class: builds strip layout, computes added mass and water-entry force per strip using Wagner model
- [x] `PlaningMotionSolver` class: integrates coupled heave/pitch EOMs via RK4; configurable time step
- [x] `compute_rao(speed, wave_freq, wave_steepness) -> PlaningRAO` high-level entry point
- [x] `PlaningRAO` dataclass: heave_rao, pitch_rao, heave_phase, pitch_phase, second_harmonic_heave
- [x] Unit tests: known closed-form limits (zero wave steepness → linear); monotonicity of 2nd harmonic with steepness
- [x] Validation: reproduce Figure 7 or Figure 8 of Tavakoli 2026 (Fridsma hull, Froude 1.19 or similar)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Enables fast-vessel seakeeping sweeps as agent tasks: vary LCG, trim, speed → map
  comfort/safety envelope autonomously
- Pairs with WRK-380 (multi-physics chain): 2D+t for fast screening → CFD for final
  design confirmation
