# feat(client2): Engineering AI Demo — Diffraction + Plate FFS + GoA + Maritime Legal System Prompts + Knowledge Base

## What

Day 1 foundation for Client 2 engineering AI demo. Client 2 focus areas:
- **Diffraction analysis** — wave-structure interaction, RAOs, QTFs, panel model setup
- **Fitness for service (FFS) for plates** — API 579-1 assessments for plate/shell geometry
  (not pipe — different remaining strength methodology)
- **Gulf of Alaska (GoA) analysis** — seismic, extreme metocean, ice loading, environmental
- **Maritime legal cases consulting** — casualty investigation support, expert witness
  technical analysis, MAIB/NTSB/USCG report interpretation, admiralty law interface

### 1. System Prompt — Client 2 Structural/Offshore Assistant

File: `ai-initiatives-client2/prompts/structural_offshore_assistant.md`

Core competencies to include:
- **Diffraction analysis**: AQWA, WAMIT, OrcaFlex wave interaction; panel model conventions;
  RAO extraction and interpretation; QTF for second-order wave loads; wave heading matrices
- **FFS for plates/shells**: API 579-1 Part 4 (general metal loss in plate), Part 5 (local LTA),
  Part 8 (shell distortions — peaking, ovality, buckles), Part 9 (crack-like flaws via FAD),
  Part 3 (brittle fracture); remaining strength factor for plate vs pipe distinction
- **GoA analysis**: API RP 2EQ seismic, API RP 2MET extreme metocean, ice loading per API RP 2N,
  environmental permitting under NEPA/ESA, extreme 100-yr wave/current parameters
- Primary codes: API RP 2EQ, API RP 2A-WSD/LRFD, ISO 19902, API 579-1, BS 7910,
  API RP 2MET, API RP 2N (Arctic), AISC 360, AWS D1.1

### 2. Knowledge Base Files

- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/api_579_plate_ffs.md` — Part 4/5/8/9 for plates;
  key distinction: plate remaining strength uses limit load vs pipe burst pressure
- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/diffraction_analysis_reference.md` — panel method
  theory; AQWA/WAMIT model setup conventions; RAO/QTF interpretation; damping models
- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/goa_design_criteria.md` — 100-yr design parameters;
  seismic zones; ice drift/pressure; BSEE GoA lease/permit context; ADEC environmental reqs
- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/api_rp_2a_structural.md` — tubular joint checks,
  member utilisation, fatigue SCFs, in-service inspection intervals

### 4. System Prompt — Maritime Legal Cases Consultant

File: `ai-initiatives-client2/prompts/maritime_legal_consultant.md`

Core competencies:
- **Casualty investigation**: MAIB (UK), NTSB Marine (US), USCG MISLE incident databases;
  root-cause taxonomy (equipment failure, human factors, weather, management system);
  ISM Code non-conformity identification; SOLAS Chapter IX compliance review
- **Expert witness support**: technical analysis for admiralty proceedings; translating
  engineering findings into lay language; report structure for legal proceedings;
  probability of causation framing; standards of care (industry vs regulatory)
- **Admiralty law interface**: collision regulations (COLREGs); salvage and wreck removal;
  limitation of liability (Limitation Act / Jones Act / MLC 2006); cargo damage claims
  (Hague-Visby Rules, Hamburg Rules); P&I Club process and club circular interpretation
- **USCG / BSEE regulatory**: CFR 46 (vessel inspection), CFR 33 (navigation), OCS safety
  regulations; incident notification requirements; MOC (management of change) for maritime
- **Incident data analysis**: leverage `worldenergydata.MAIBLoader` + `NTSBMarineLoader`
  (WRK-320 done) for statistical incident context; vessel type vs failure mode correlation;
  comparable casualty precedents for damages estimation

Primary references: MAIB investigation reports, NTSB marine accident reports, USCG Marine
Casualty Reports, ISM Code, SOLAS, MARPOL, COLREGs, MLC 2006, Jones Act (46 USC 30104),
Limitation of Shipowners' Liability Act (46 USC 30501-30512)

### 5. Knowledge Base Files — Maritime Legal

- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/maritime_casualty_investigation.md` — MAIB/NTSB/USCG
  investigation process; ISM Code audit framework; root-cause taxonomy table
- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/admiralty_law_reference.md` — COLREGs rules summary;
  Jones Act key provisions; limitation of liability thresholds; P&I Club claim stages
- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/expert_witness_framework.md` — report structure for
  legal proceedings; Daubert standard (US) / Civil Evidence Act (UK); how to frame
  engineering opinion as standard of care; deposition preparation checklist

## Why

Client 2's disciplines are structurally different from Client 1:
- Diffraction is a numerical/frequency-domain speciality — the AI context files need to carry
  the panel model conventions and output format knowledge
- Plate FFS follows different methodology than pipe FFS (Part 4/5 uses net-section collapse for
  plates, not burst pressure) — requires separate knowledge base
- GoA context overlaps with Client 1 but adds Arctic/seismic dimension unique to this client

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System prompt created at `ai-initiatives-client2/prompts/structural_offshore_assistant.md`
- [ ] 4 knowledge base markdown files created
- [ ] Maritime legal system prompt created with MAIB/NTSB/COLREGs/Jones Act coverage
- [ ] 3 maritime legal knowledge base files created
- [ ] 5 test questions validated per focus area (diffraction, plate FFS, GoA, maritime legal)
- [ ] FFS plate vs pipe distinction clearly handled in system prompt
- [ ] Expert witness report structure included in maritime prompt
- [ ] No client-specific proprietary data — public codes/standards only
- [ ] `target_repos` updated from TBD to actual client repo when created
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Note on Target Repo

`TBD-client2-repo` — client repo not yet created. Update `target_repos` when
the client git repo is initialised (pattern: `<client-shortname>` repo, exempt from src/ layout).

## Agentic AI Horizon

Same pattern as WRK-625. Codex drafts files; Claude validates engineering accuracy.
Diffraction system prompt requires careful review — AQWA panel conventions are nuanced.
