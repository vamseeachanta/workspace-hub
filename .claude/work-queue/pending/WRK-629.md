# feat(client2): Engineering AI Demo — Diffraction + Plate FFS + GoA System Prompts + Knowledge Base

## What

Day 1 foundation for Client 2 engineering AI demo. Client 2 focus areas:
- **Diffraction analysis** — wave-structure interaction, RAOs, QTFs, panel model setup
- **Fitness for service (FFS) for plates** — API 579-1 assessments for plate/shell geometry
  (not pipe — different remaining strength methodology)
- **Gulf of Alaska (GoA) analysis** — seismic, extreme metocean, ice loading, environmental

### 1. System Prompt — Client 2 Structural/Offshore Assistant

File: `ai-initiatives-client2/prompts/structural_offshore_assistant.md`

Core competencies to include:
- **Diffraction analysis**: AQWA, WAMIT, OrcaFlex wave interaction; panel model conventions;
  RAO extraction and interpretation; QTF for second-order wave loads; wave heading matrices
- **FFS for plates/shells**: API 579-1 Part 4 (general metal loss in plate), Part 5 (local LTA),
  Part 8 (shell distortions — peaking, ovality, buckles), Part 9 (crack-like flaws via FAD),
  Part 3 (brittle fracture); remaining strength factor for plate vs pipe distinction
- **GoA analysis**: API RP 2EQ seismic, API RP 2MET extreme metocean, ice loading per API RP 2N,
  environmental permitting under NEPA/ESA, extreme 100-yr wave/current parameters
- Primary codes: API RP 2EQ, API RP 2A-WSD/LRFD, ISO 19902, API 579-1, BS 7910,
  API RP 2MET, API RP 2N (Arctic), AISC 360, AWS D1.1

### 2. Knowledge Base Files

- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/api_579_plate_ffs.md` — Part 4/5/8/9 for plates;
  key distinction: plate remaining strength uses limit load vs pipe burst pressure
- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/diffraction_analysis_reference.md` — panel method
  theory; AQWA/WAMIT model setup conventions; RAO/QTF interpretation; damping models
- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/goa_design_criteria.md` — 100-yr design parameters;
  seismic zones; ice drift/pressure; BSEE GoA lease/permit context; ADEC environmental reqs
- `ai-initiatives-client2/knowledge/api_rp_2a_structural.md` — tubular joint checks,
  member utilisation, fatigue SCFs, in-service inspection intervals

### 3. Folder Scaffold

```

## Why

Client 2's disciplines are structurally different from Client 1:
- Diffraction is a numerical/frequency-domain speciality — the AI context files need to carry
  the panel model conventions and output format knowledge
- Plate FFS follows different methodology than pipe FFS (Part 4/5 uses net-section collapse for
  plates, not burst pressure) — requires separate knowledge base
- GoA context overlaps with Client 1 but adds Arctic/seismic dimension unique to this client

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System prompt created at `ai-initiatives-client2/prompts/structural_offshore_assistant.md`
- [ ] 4 knowledge base markdown files created
- [ ] 5 test questions validated per focus area (diffraction, plate FFS, GoA)
- [ ] FFS plate vs pipe distinction clearly handled in system prompt
- [ ] No client-specific proprietary data — public codes/standards only
- [ ] `target_repos` updated from TBD to actual client repo when created
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Note on Target Repo

`TBD-client2-repo` — client repo not yet created. Update `target_repos` when
the client git repo is initialised (pattern: `<client-shortname>` repo, exempt from src/ layout).

## Agentic AI Horizon

Same pattern as WRK-625. Codex drafts files; Claude validates engineering accuracy.
Diffraction system prompt requires careful review — AQWA panel conventions are nuanced.
