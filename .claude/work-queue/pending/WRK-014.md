# HSE risk index — present client-facing risk insights with risk scoring

## What
Design and build a risk index framework that translates HSE incident analysis (WRK-013) into actionable risk scores for client presentation. The risk index should help clients understand the relative risk associated with different activities, locations, or operations based on historical incident data.

## Why
Raw incident data and frequency tables are not directly actionable for clients. A risk index provides an intuitive, comparable metric that enables informed decision-making about safety investments, operational planning, and risk mitigation priorities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define risk index methodology (factors: frequency, severity, consequence, exposure)
- [ ] Design risk scoring scale (e.g., 1-10, low/medium/high/critical)
- [ ] Calculate risk index per activity/subactivity category
- [ ] Present results in client-ready format (tables, charts, dashboards)
- [ ] Include risk comparison across categories for prioritization
- [ ] Document methodology transparently for client review
- [ ] Include caveats and data limitations
- [ ] Validate risk rankings against industry knowledge and common sense checks
