# Evaluate cowork relevance — repo ecosystem fit vs agentic coding momentum

## What

Review the workspace-hub repo ecosystem and current working style to determine whether cowork has any viable use cases. Given that native agentic coding (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) is advancing rapidly over the next 3 months, assess whether cowork is worth prioritising or should be deprioritised/removed.

## Why

There is a large backlog of meaningful engineering work across repos. Time and attention spent integrating or maintaining cowork is an opportunity cost. The question is whether cowork provides capabilities not covered by the existing Claude/Codex/Gemini orchestration, or whether it is redundant given the trajectory of agentic tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define what cowork offers (features, integration model) vs what native Claude Code/Codex/Gemini already provide
- [ ] Identify any specific use cases in this ecosystem where cowork would add unique value
- [ ] Assess the 3-month agentic coding roadmap: are those cowork use cases likely to be covered natively?
- [ ] Give a clear recommendation: prioritise / monitor / deprioritise / remove cowork from the ecosystem
- [ ] If deprioritising, identify any cowork-specific skills or configs to archive

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Evaluating cowork's relevance as agentic coding momentum grows is a strategic decision about where collaborative coding tooling fits — important for avoiding wasted investment.
- The cowork vs agentic coding trade-off question will be sharper in 3–4 months when agentic pair-programming is more mature.
- **Disposition: park 2-3 months** — defer the cowork decision to April 2026 when the agentic coding landscape is clearer; don't invest in cowork features now.
