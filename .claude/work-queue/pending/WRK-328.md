# WRK-328 — Create ORCAFLEX_MODELS.md — per-example engineering model cards

**Status:** in_progress | **Priority:** high | **Percent complete:** 0

## Goal

Read the `includes/*.yml` files for representative OrcaFlex modular examples (one per
letter group) and produce `docs/domains/orcaflex/examples/ORCAFLEX_MODELS.md` — a
structured per-model engineering description that explains what each example actually
contains, not just its parameters.

## Scope

~12 representative examples, one per letter group:
A01 (catenary + lazy wave), B01 (drilling), C06 (CALM buoy), D02 (installation),
E01 (S-lay), F01 (subsea install), K01 (FOWT), L01 (vessel), L03 (semi-sub),
M01 (pipeline), Z02 (edge case)

## Output file

`digitalmodel/docs/domains/orcaflex/examples/ORCAFLEX_MODELS.md`

## Acceptance criteria

- Per-example model card: structure type, key object properties, analysis intent,
  environment summary, notable features, expected results
- Cross-reference to PARAMETER_REFERENCE.md and run_orcaflex.py scripts
- Covers all letter groups (A–M, Z) at least at summary level
