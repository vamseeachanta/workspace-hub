# Build interactive NPV calculator for website lead generation

## What
Build a browser-based interactive NPV calculator as a lead magnet tool. Follow the pattern established by the existing fatigue-life and S-N curve calculators. Allows prospects to input field development parameters and get NPV/IRR estimates.

## Why
The existing fatigue calculators demonstrate the "try before you buy" pattern for engineering services. No equivalent exists for energy data services. An NPV calculator gives energy investors and operators a tangible way to experience the platform value.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] HTML/JS calculator page in calculators/ directory
- [ ] Inputs: production profile, oil price, CAPEX, OPEX, discount rate, tax rate
- [ ] Outputs: NPV, IRR, MIRR, payback period, cashflow chart
- [ ] Interactive Plotly chart showing cumulative cashflow
- [ ] Matches existing calculator UI pattern (Bootstrap + marketing.css)
- [ ] No server required (client-side JS)
- [ ] Linked from energy.html calculators mention and engineering.html calculators section
