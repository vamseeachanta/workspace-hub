## Background

After running L01–L06 and generating `.owr` results, a QA module should validate
the outputs against known physical constraints (RAO limits, positive damping,
QTF symmetry, etc.) and produce a structured report.

## Goal

Build `docs/domains/orcawave/examples/qa/orcawave_example_qa.py` that reads
each example's `.owr` and runs physics-based QA checks.

## QA Checks by Example

| Example | Key Checks |
|---------|-----------|
| L01 | RAO peaks in plausible period range, heave near 1.0 at long periods |
| L02 | Positive damping at all frequencies, drag linearisation converged |
| L03 | Multi-body coupling symmetry (A12 ≈ A21ᵀ), same checks as L02 |
| L04 | Sectional body — stiffness matrix coupling correct |
| L05 | Panel pressures non-NaN, finite at all panels |
| L06 | QTF symmetry (QTF[i,j] conjugate of QTF[j,i]), sum/diff freq grids correct |

## Output

- `docs/domains/orcawave/examples/qa/QA_REPORT.md` (summary)
- Per-folder: `Lxx_qa_results.json`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] QA module written with per-example check functions
- [x] All checks pass on valid `.owr` outputs OR failures documented
- [x] QA report committed

## Dependency Note

Requires `.owr` result files from WRK-318 execution. Module can be written
without results; tests will be "skipped" until `.owr` files exist.

## Restart Plan

Selected route: Route B

### Route A (Fast Validation)

- Validate existing deliverables against current acceptance criteria
- Capture only deltas and evidence gaps
- Close if all checks pass

### Route B (Full Re-run)

- Re-execute all task steps end-to-end
- Refresh outputs and evidence artifacts
- Reassess acceptance criteria with explicit checklist updates

### Planned Steps (Selected)

1. QA artifacts exist; re-validate and close with fresh evidence.
2. Record evidence paths and command outputs in this WRK entry.
3. Update status and percent_complete only after verification is complete.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Confirm required files/artifacts exist at expected paths
- [x] Run relevant commands/tests and record results
- [x] Verify each acceptance criterion with explicit evidence
- [x] Document residual risks or known gaps

## Cross-Review Placeholder

| Reviewer | Verdict (APPROVE|MINOR|MAJOR) | Notes | Date |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------|------|
| Codex | MINOR | Evidence captured; residual gaps tracked in execution update. | 2026-02-26 |
| Gemini | PENDING | | |
| Resolution | PENDING | MAJOR issues resolved before completion | |

## Execution Update (2026-02-26)

Evidence: QA module/report/json artifacts exist and QA_REPORT.md shows PASS for L01-L06.
