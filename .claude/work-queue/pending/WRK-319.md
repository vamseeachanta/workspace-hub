## Background

After running L01–L06 and generating `.owr` results, a QA module should validate
the outputs against known physical constraints (RAO limits, positive damping,
QTF symmetry, etc.) and produce a structured report.

## Goal

Build `docs/domains/orcawave/examples/qa/orcawave_example_qa.py` that reads
each example's `.owr` and runs physics-based QA checks.

## QA Checks by Example

| Example | Key Checks |
|---------|-----------|
| L01 | RAO peaks in plausible period range, heave near 1.0 at long periods |
| L02 | Positive damping at all frequencies, drag linearisation converged |
| L03 | Multi-body coupling symmetry (A12 ≈ A21ᵀ), same checks as L02 |
| L04 | Sectional body — stiffness matrix coupling correct |
| L05 | Panel pressures non-NaN, finite at all panels |
| L06 | QTF symmetry (QTF[i,j] conjugate of QTF[j,i]), sum/diff freq grids correct |

## Output

- `docs/domains/orcawave/examples/qa/QA_REPORT.md` (summary)
- Per-folder: `Lxx_qa_results.json`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] QA module written with per-example check functions
- [ ] All checks pass on valid `.owr` outputs OR failures documented
- [ ] QA report committed

## Dependency Note

Requires `.owr` result files from WRK-318 execution. Module can be written
without results; tests will be "skipped" until `.owr` files exist.
