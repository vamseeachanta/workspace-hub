# Real-time EIA and IEA feed ingestion — weekly crude and gas production

## What

Set up weekly automated ingestion of EIA API (US crude/gas production, imports, stocks) and
IEA data feeds. Store as time-series JSONL. Wire into existing worldenergydata data pipeline.
Requires EIA_API_KEY env var.

## Why

EIA weekly data is the most timely publicly available US energy production dataset, used across
the industry for supply/demand analysis. Automating ingestion keeps worldenergydata current
without manual downloads and enables time-series analysis of production trends, inventory
levels, and import/export patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EIA API v2 client: weekly petroleum status report series (crude production, stocks,
      imports, refinery utilisation)
- [ ] EIA API v2 client: natural gas weekly storage report
- [ ] JSONL storage format with schema versioning
- [ ] Incremental ingestion: only fetch new data since last run
- [ ] CLI: `worldenergydata eia-sync` for manual trigger
- [ ] Cron-compatible script for weekly automation
- [ ] EIA_API_KEY loaded from environment variable (validated at startup)
- [ ] Pytest coverage with mocked API responses
