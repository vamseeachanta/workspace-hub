# Geomechanics Module Feasibility Assessment

## What

Assess feasibility of creating a geomechanics module in digitalmodel using
OpenGeoSys and/or MOOSE INL frameworks. Focus on wellbore integrity and
CO2 storage simulation use cases.

## Why

WRK-383 identified geomechanics as a gap (no current module). OpenGeoSys
covers THMC (thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical) processes. MOOSE INL is
DOE-backed multiphysics. Both are Python-accessible.

## Deliverables

- Feasibility report comparing OpenGeoSys vs MOOSE for target use cases
- Installation test on ace-linux-1/2
- Proof-of-concept: simple wellbore integrity calculation
- Go/no-go recommendation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Both frameworks installed and tested
- [ ] Python API functionality verified
- [ ] Simple benchmark problem executed
- [ ] Comparison table: capabilities, license, community health, deps
- [ ] Recommendation documented
