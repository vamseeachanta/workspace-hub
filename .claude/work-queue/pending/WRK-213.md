# WRK-213: Codex Multi-Agent Roles — Assessment and Integration

## What

Codex 0.102.0 shipped native multi-agent role configuration via
`.codex/config.toml` + `agents/role_config.toml` files. Assess how this maps
to workspace-hub's existing agent skill approach (WRK-212), and determine
what should be adopted natively vs kept as workspace-specific skill files.

## Context

From @LLMJunky's "Codex Multi-Agent Playbook Part 1" (2026-02-19, 70K views):

- **Three built-in roles**: `default`, `explorer`, `worker`
- **Custom roles**: `.codex/config.toml` + per-agent `agents/role_config.toml`
  — model, reasoning level, system prompt, permissions, MCP servers
- **Hierarchical scope**: project vs global (mirrors AGENTS.md pattern)
- **Default cap**: 6 parallel agents; configurable to `max_threads = 12`+
- **Skills ↔ subagents**: callable from each other (bidirectional)
- **25 pre-built roles**: github.com/am-will/codex-skills/tree/main/agents

**Key insight**: What workspace-hub builds manually (agent `.md` files + spawn
prompts) is now natively supported in Codex via TOML config. The Claude Code
equivalent is the agent-teams skill (WRK-212). The two ecosystems are
converging on the same architectural pattern.

## Questions to answer

1. Are the 25 pre-built Codex roles worth importing as workspace-hub skills
   (or linking as `canonical_ref:` in `_diverged/`)?
2. Does `.codex/config.toml` `max_threads = 12` affect how we think about
   MAX_TEAMMATES=3 in Claude Code? (Different systems — don't conflate)
3. Should workspace-hub's `.codex/skills` symlinks (WRK-198-202) reference
   these new Codex role configs, or are they separate?
4. Is there a `CODEX.md` equivalent pattern to document Codex-side agent
   roles for the workspace?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Assess 25 pre-built Codex roles — identify any worth adopting
- [ ] Document Codex role config approach in `.codex/CODEX.md` (already exists)
- [ ] Determine if workspace-hub needs a Codex-side agent skill that mirrors
      the Claude Code `agent-teams` skill
- [ ] Update WRK-212 if Codex native roles reduce what Claude Code needs to handle

## Plan

Awaiting plan. Route A sufficient — research + doc updates only.
No cross-review required unless adopting Codex roles changes shared config.
