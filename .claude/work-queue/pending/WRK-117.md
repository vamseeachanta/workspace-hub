# Refine and Coarsen Hull Panel Meshes for Mesh Convergence Sensitivity

## What
Build mesh refinement and coarsening tools that take a cataloged hull panel mesh and produce finer or coarser versions for mesh convergence studies in hydrodynamic diffraction analysis. Generate a family of meshes (e.g., coarse/medium/fine/very-fine) from a single source hull to systematically test sensitivity of RAO results to panel density.

## Why
Mesh convergence is a fundamental quality check in any panel-method diffraction analysis. Analysts need to demonstrate that results (added mass, damping, RAOs) are insensitive to further mesh refinement. Currently this requires manual re-meshing in external tools. Automating refinement/coarsening within the hull library enables systematic convergence studies directly from the catalog, feeding into solver benchmarking (WRK-031).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Mesh refinement: subdivide each quad panel into 4 (or 9) sub-panels with interpolated vertices
- [ ] Mesh coarsening: merge adjacent panels to reduce panel count while preserving hull shape
- [ ] Generate mesh family from single source (e.g., 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x panel density)
- [ ] Preserve hull geometry fidelity: coarsened mesh stays within tolerance of original surface
- [ ] Output each mesh variant as GDF file with descriptive naming (e.g., hull_name_coarse_500p.gdf)
- [ ] Mesh quality metrics: aspect ratio, skewness, min/max panel area per variant
- [ ] Convergence report template: table of mesh variants with panel count and key results columns
- [ ] Tests covering refinement, coarsening, quality metrics, and GDF output
