# Audit Official MCP Registry for Engineering-Domain Servers

## What

Systematically query the MCP Official Registry
(registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) programmatic API for engineering-domain
servers. Filter by keywords: geospatial, scientific data, unit conversion,
weather, structural analysis, marine, energy, geology.

## Why

The registry holds ~2000 servers (as of Feb 2026). A targeted audit would
identify servers installable into workspace-hub with zero integration code,
accelerating agent capability without custom development.

## Deliverables

- Skill at `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/mcp-registry-audit/` that queries
  the registry API and filters by engineering keywords
- Output: priority-ranked install list with trust assessment per server

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Skill queries registry API and returns filtered results
- [ ] Each result includes: name, description, relevance score, trust notes
- [ ] Top 10 candidates documented with install instructions
- [ ] Supply-chain security checklist applied to each candidate
