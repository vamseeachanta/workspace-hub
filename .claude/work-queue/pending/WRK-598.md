# Engineering Chatbot for Oil & Gas — Product Build

## What

Build a domain-specific AI chatbot for offshore oil and gas engineering
clients, covering subsea engineering, floating systems, riser analysis,
mooring design, and fatigue assessment.

## Why

Engineering judgment encoded into a scalable product. Domain expertise
in riser analysis, fatigue, FDAS/FPSO systems, CALM buoys, and vessel
motions is the competitive moat generic AI companies cannot replicate.
Revenue model: per-seat SaaS (Phase 1) → per-project (Phase 2–3) →
annual enterprise contracts (Phase 4–5).

## Phased Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Smart Knowledge Base *(MVP)*
- Conversational access to engineering standards (API, DNV, ABS)
- Methodology explainers (fatigue, CALM buoy mooring, FDAS)
- Glossary/acronym resolution
- Engineer onboarding support
- **Pricing:** Per seat / month

### Phase 2 — Project Document Intelligence (RAG)
- Natural language queries on uploaded project documents
- Cross-referencing design basis, metocean reports, vessel data
- Parameter extraction from PDFs/spreadsheets
- Revision change tracking
- **Pricing:** Per project

### Phase 3 — Analysis Pre-Processor & QC Tool
- Automated OrcaFlex input file generation
- Pre-run sanity checks on analysis inputs
- Post-processing results into client-ready tables
- Fatigue life workflows with S-N curve guidance
- Vessel motion data parsing (RAOs, time series)
- **Pricing:** Per project

### Phase 4 — Engineering Review Assistant
- Automated report vs. design basis compliance checks
- Inconsistency flagging across documents
- Code/standard compliance checking
- Lessons-learned database
- **Pricing:** Annual contract

### Phase 5 — Digital Engineering Advisor *(Long-Term)*
- Concept screening (riser configs, mooring concepts)
- Historical project benchmarking
- Risk identification from similar projects
- Real-time monitoring integration
- **Pricing:** Annual contract

## Technical Stack

- **LLM Backend:** Claude API (Anthropic)
- **RAG Framework:** LlamaIndex or LangChain with vector store
- **Document Processing:** PDF/Excel extraction pipeline
- **Deployment:** Cloud-hosted API with web frontend
- **Auth/Billing:** Stripe + OAuth

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Draft system prompt for Phase 1 prototype
- [ ] Identify pilot client for demo
- [ ] Build document ingestion pipeline for Phase 2
- [ ] Define engineering QA test cases
- [ ] Prepare client pitch deck
- [ ] Cost estimate for hosting and API usage
