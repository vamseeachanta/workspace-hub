# Personal Habit — Get to the Point Immediately When Asking Leaders Questions

## What

Stop prefacing questions to leaders with contextual introductions, background framing, or
preambles before stating the actual question. Ask the question first, then provide context
only if they ask for it.

## Why

Leaders operate on compressed time. A 30-second introduction before a 10-second question
signals poor communication judgment and wastes the most expensive seconds of the interaction.
Getting to the point immediately demonstrates confidence, clarity, and respect for their time.
It also makes the question easier to answer — they can start forming the answer while you
talk, rather than waiting for the question to arrive.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] For the next 10 interactions with a leader or senior stakeholder: question or request stated within the first sentence
- [ ] No interaction begins with "So I just wanted to..." / "I've been thinking about..." / "Quick context before I ask..." or equivalent preambles
- [ ] If context is genuinely needed, it follows the question, not precedes it: "Can we extend the deadline? The scope changed last week."
- [ ] Self-assessment after 10 interactions: has the pattern held? Are responses faster and more useful?

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Not applicable — this is a personal communication habit
