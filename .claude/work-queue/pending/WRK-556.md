# feat(digitalmodel/marine): Implement API RP 2I — API RP 2I 3rd Ed (2008) In-service Inspection of M

## Standard
- **Standard**: API RP 2I
- **Full title**: API RP 2I 3rd Ed (2008) In-service Inspection of Mooring Hardware for Floating Structures
- **Domain**: marine
- **Document path**: `/mnt/ace/0000 O&G/0000 Codes & Standards/AS/API/API Recommended Practice/API RP 2I/API RP 2I 3rd Ed (2008) In-service Inspection of Mooring Hardware for Floating Structures.pdf`

## What

Implement engineering calculations and data models from **API RP 2I**
in the `digitalmodel` repository, module `marine`.

This standard was identified in Phase C/E of WRK-309 (Document Intelligence)
as a gap — the document exists on the drives but its content has not been
implemented in the target repo.

## Why

**API RP 2I** is a key industry standard in the `marine` domain.
Implementing its calculations enables agents and engineers to perform
rigorous code-compliant analysis directly from the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core calculations / design checks implemented with unit tests
- [ ] Input validation at parameter boundaries
- [ ] Docstring cites the standard clause/equation numbers
- [ ] Example usage verified against standard worked example (if available)
- [ ] Cross-review passed via `scripts/review/cross-review.sh`
