# Agent Usage Credits Display

## What
Display agent usage credits and remaining weekly quota at the start of every agent session (claude, codex, gemini). Provides a quick dashboard so the user can plan which tasks to tackle given available budget.

## Why
Without visibility into remaining credits, sessions get interrupted mid-task when quotas run out. Showing usage upfront enables:
- **Weekly planning**: allocate heavy tasks (cross-reviews, large implementations) to days with high remaining quota
- **Session scoping**: choose smaller tasks when credits are low
- **Cost awareness**: track burn rate across agents over time
- **No surprises**: avoid starting a 2-hour task with 10 minutes of quota left

## Scope

### a/ Per-Agent Usage Query
- **Claude Code**: query usage via `claude` CLI or Anthropic API billing endpoint
- **Codex CLI**: query usage via OpenAI API usage endpoint
- **Gemini CLI**: query usage via Google AI API usage endpoint
- Determine which agents expose usage/quota data programmatically vs. require scraping a dashboard
- Fallback: if no API available, prompt user to manually enter quota (cached locally)

### b/ Session Startup Display
- On every new agent session, display a compact summary:
  ```
  Agent Credits (week of 2026-02-10):
    claude:  ███████░░░  72% remaining (18/25 hrs)
    codex:   █████░░░░░  50% remaining
    gemini:  ████████░░  80% remaining
  ```
- Color-coded: green (>50%), yellow (20-50%), red (<20%)
- Show absolute numbers where available, percentage otherwise
- Total wall-clock time or token count depending on what each API reports

### c/ Weekly Budget Tracking
- Log usage per session to `~/.agent-usage/weekly-log.jsonl`
- Each entry: `{timestamp, agent, tokens_used, duration_s, task_summary}`
- Weekly rollup script to summarize burn rate and project remaining capacity
- Reset tracking on Monday (configurable)

### d/ Integration with Shell Startup
- Hook into the same shell profile mechanism as WRK-050 Phase 4
- `dev-env-check.sh` / `.ps1` calls usage query as part of startup
- Keep total startup time <2s (usage query should be async/cached)
- Cache last-known usage for 15 minutes to avoid API calls on every terminal open

### e/ Planning Recommendations (stretch)
- Based on remaining weekly quota, suggest task sizing:
  - ">70% remaining": safe to run cross-reviews, large implementations
  - "30-70%": medium tasks, single-module work
  - "<30%": small fixes, documentation, planning only
- Optional: integrate with work queue to flag which WRK items fit remaining budget

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Usage query works for at least claude CLI (primary agent)
- [ ] Compact usage summary displayed at session start
- [ ] Weekly usage logged to local file
- [ ] Cached to avoid slow startup
- [ ] Works on Linux; Windows support follows WRK-050 Phase 4
- [ ] Degrades gracefully if API unreachable (show "unknown" not error)

## Technical Notes
- Anthropic API: `GET /v1/usage` or check console.anthropic.com — research exact endpoint
- OpenAI API: `GET /v1/usage` or `GET /dashboard/billing/usage` — research exact endpoint
- Google AI: research Gemini API usage tracking
- Some agents may be on flat-rate plans (e.g. Claude Max) — handle "unlimited" as a valid state
- Privacy: usage logs stay local (`~/.agent-usage/`), never committed to repo

## Plan

*To be written after WRK-050 Phase 4 shell startup infrastructure is in place. The usage display will plug into the same `dev-env-check` script.*
