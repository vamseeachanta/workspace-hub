# Online Resources Research — Expanded Discovery of Skills, Data APIs and References for Workspace-Hub

## What

A broad, exploratory research mission to discover and catalog **online resources** —
beyond what the ecosystem currently uses or is aware of — that could materially enhance
the workspace-hub repo system. This is not documentation of known sources: it is active
discovery. Output: a structured `specs/online-resources/catalog.yaml` and supporting
narrative covering eight categories spanning engineering data, standards, open-source
tooling, academic literature, live operational feeds, AI/agent resources, sustainability
data, and professional community knowledge bases.

## Why

WRK-383 maps *local* documents → modules. This WRK asks: **what exists online that we
don't yet know about, haven't wired in, or haven't considered?**

The goal is to surface resources that:
- Fill module capability gaps with authoritative live data or reference material
- Enable agents to reach beyond the local library at task time
- Identify unexplored domains adjacent to the current module set (e.g., ESG/carbon,
  subsurface geomechanics, manufacturing supply chain) that are natural future modules
- Reveal open-source tools and communities that could become dependencies or inspirations
- Build a "discovery backlog" — a prioritised list of follow-on WRK items

This is a **horizon-expanding** exercise, not an inventory of the familiar.

## Scope

### Category 1 — Engineering Standards and Codes Portals

Go beyond the known (DNV, API, ISO) to map the full landscape:
- DNV, API, BS, ISO, ASME, ASTM, NACE, IEC, ABS, BV, LR, ClassNK — free viewer portals,
  errata pages, publicly accessible scope documents
- Regulatory portals: BSEE, USCG, IMO GISIS, NSTA (UK), NPD/Sodir (Norway), PTTEP (SE Asia)
- Open-access standards: NFPA free reads, some ISO previews, IEC public documents
- Regional bodies not currently in scope: PETRONAS PCSB standards, Standards Australia,
  South American regulatory bodies (ANP Brazil, Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos Colombia)
- Research into errata and amendment tracking — do any bodies provide change-log feeds?

### Category 2 — Open Data APIs (energy, metocean, regulatory)

Audit current APIs used by `worldenergydata` and discover new ones:

| Source | Module | Discover |

## Deliverables

1. `specs/online-resources/catalog.yaml` — machine-readable catalog, fields:
   `name`, `category`, `subcategory`, `url`, `auth_required`, `cost_model`,
   `relevance_score` (1–5), `related_module`, `maturity` (live/beta/sunset),
   `notes`, `discovery_status` (known/new/investigate)
2. `specs/online-resources/README.md` — narrative summary with top-5 per category,
   key findings, and a "things we didn't know existed" highlight section
3. `specs/online-resources/follow-on-candidates.md` — prioritised list of follow-on
   WRK items identified during research, ready to capture

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `catalog.yaml` exists with ≥80 catalogued resources across all 8 categories
- [ ] Every category has ≥5 entries; Categories 2, 3, 5, 8 have ≥10 each
- [ ] Category 5 covers SPE, SNAME, ASME, ISOPE, OTC/OMAE, RINA, IOGP, TWI with
      explicit notes on free-access tier, embargo period, and any API/bulk-access path
- [ ] Each entry has `relevance_score`, `discovery_status`, and `related_module`
- [ ] README.md includes a "new discoveries" section highlighting resources not previously
      in scope for the ecosystem
- [ ] `follow-on-candidates.md` lists ≥5 actionable WRK candidates with brief rationale
- [ ] At least one resource identified per currently-gapped module in WRK-383
- [ ] Legal scan passes on all output files

## Agentic AI Horizon

- This catalog becomes a **Plan gate resource** — before generating a plan, agents query
  `catalog.yaml` to know what online sources are available for the domain in scope.
- Categories 2 and 6 (live APIs and real-time feeds) directly enable agents to fetch
  authoritative data rather than relying on stale local copies.
- Category 8 (MCP ecosystem) is the most self-referential: discovering MCP servers we
  should install directly accelerates agent capability without any code changes.
- In 3–4 months this catalog becomes self-updating if we wire in an agent that periodically
  re-crawls registry endpoints and updates `discovery_status`; the groundwork laid here
  defines the schema and initial population.
- The "things we didn't know existed" finds are the highest-leverage outcomes — they open
  new capability directions that no amount of incremental planning would have found.
