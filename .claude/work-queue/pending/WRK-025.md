# AQWA Diffraction Analysis Runner

## What
Add the ability to run AQWA diffraction analysis from digitalmodel. This includes invoking AQWA solvers, managing license checks, and handling execution lifecycle (pre/post hooks).

## Why
Diffraction analysis is a core hydrodynamic capability. AQWA is a widely-used tool for computing wave loads, RAOs, and motion responses. Automating the run process reduces manual effort and ensures repeatability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AQWA solver invocation with configurable parameters
- [ ] License/environment validation before run
- [ ] Run status tracking (queued, running, completed, failed)
- [ ] Log capture and error reporting
- [ ] Integration with batch analysis pipeline (WRK-027)
