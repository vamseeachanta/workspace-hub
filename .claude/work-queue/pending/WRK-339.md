# Aluminium structural module — Eurocode 9 and AA ADM member capacity checks

## What

Implement aluminium member capacity checks per Eurocode 9 (EN 1999-1-1) and Aluminium
Association ADM. Cross-section classification, axial, bending, combined loading checks, HAZ
factors. For marine and offshore aluminium structures.

## Why

Aluminium is widely used in offshore helidecks, accommodation modules, and marine
superstructures. Design codes for aluminium differ significantly from steel (HAZ softening,
different buckling curves, cross-section classification). Having Eurocode 9 and AA ADM checks
in acma-projects enables dual-code aluminium structural design.

## Standards

- Eurocode 9 (EN 1999-1-1)
- Aluminium Association ADM

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cross-section classification per Eurocode 9 (Class 1-4)
- [ ] Axial compression: column buckling with aluminium-specific curves
- [ ] Axial tension capacity
- [ ] Bending capacity: lateral-torsional buckling
- [ ] Combined axial + bending interaction checks
- [ ] HAZ (Heat Affected Zone) softening factors for welded connections
- [ ] AA ADM equivalent checks for US-code projects
- [ ] Alloy property database: 5083, 6061, 6082 (common marine grades)
- [ ] Pytest coverage with published example calculations
