# HSE data analysis — identify typical mishaps by activity and subactivity

## What
Analyze the collected HSE incident data to identify typical mishaps (incident types, frequencies, severities) categorized by activity and subactivity. Build a taxonomy of activities (e.g., drilling, production, installation, maintenance) and subactivities, then map incident patterns to each category.

## Why
Understanding which activities carry the highest incident rates and what types of mishaps are most common enables targeted safety interventions. This analysis forms the analytical backbone for the client-facing risk index (WRK-014).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define activity and subactivity taxonomy for HSE data
- [ ] Classify incidents by activity/subactivity across all data sources
- [ ] Identify top mishap types per activity category
- [ ] Calculate frequency and severity distributions
- [ ] Identify patterns and correlations (e.g., seasonal, geographic, equipment-related)
- [ ] Produce summary tables and visualizations
- [ ] Document methodology and assumptions
- [ ] Validate findings against known industry benchmarks where possible
