# Add Heavy Construction/Installation Vessel Data

## What
Create a data module in worldenergydata for heavy construction and installation vessels (crane vessels, pipelay vessels, heavy-lift vessels, etc.) with fleet inventory data suitable for offshore engineering use.

## Why
Heavy construction and installation vessels are critical for offshore project planning and engineering analysis. Having a structured dataset of vessel capabilities (crane capacity, deck space, pipelay tension, vessel dimensions, operational limits) enables quick lookup and comparison for feasibility studies and installation engineering.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data schema for heavy construction/installation vessels (dimensions, crane capacity, deck area, operational limits, etc.)
- [ ] Fleet data sourced from publicly available vessel databases
- [ ] Data loader with query capabilities (by vessel name, type, capacity range)
- [ ] Storage format consistent with existing worldenergydata patterns
- [ ] Unit tests for data loading and schema validation
