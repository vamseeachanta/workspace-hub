# Superintelligent Engineering Agent Architecture

## What

Define and document the canonical architecture for turning tier-1 repos into collections
of superintelligent engineering agents. Output: `specs/architecture/agent-vision.md`
and `specs/architecture/capability-tiers.yaml`.

## Why

Every future WRK item should advance the repos toward this vision. Without a canonical
blueprint, WRK items are fragmented optimisations. With it, they become coordinated steps
toward a defined end state: autonomous engineering agents that can read standards, perform
calculations, validate against code, and produce engineering deliverables — with minimal
human prompting.

## The Three Capability Tiers

### Tier 1 — Engineering Calculator (current state for most modules)
- Accepts structured inputs, returns structured outputs
- Implements a specific standard calculation
- Testable, deterministic, documented
- Example: `digitalmodel.structural.fatigue.calculate_damage(cycles, sn_curve)`

### Tier 2 — Engineering Assistant (target for 2026)
- Reads engineering requirements in natural language
- Selects the right modules and sequences them
- Validates outputs against code limits
- Produces structured calculation reports
- Example: "Check fatigue life of tubular joint T1 per DNV-RP-C203 using JONSWAP scatter"
  → agent reads scatter matrix → runs spectral fatigue → checks D < 1.0 → produces calc sheet

### Tier 3 — Autonomous Engineering Agent (vision, 2027+)
- Receives project brief (water depth, metocean, asset type, regulatory regime)
- Autonomously selects applicable standards and design methodology
- Iterates design until all code checks pass
- Identifies gaps and spawns new WRK items to fill them
- Produces stamped calculation packages

## Repo Roles in the Agent Architecture

### digitalmodel — Engineering Calculation Engine
- **Role**: Tier 1 now → Tier 2 target
- **Agent interface**: unified `ace.calc(module, inputs)` dispatcher
- **Knowledge source**: Module registry (WRK-384) + Standards capability map (WRK-383)
- **Key gap**: No agent-callable API layer; no standards-to-function traceability

### worldenergydata — Market and Field Intelligence Agent
- **Role**: Tier 1 data aggregation now → Tier 2 synthesis target
- **Agent interface**: unified query API across BSEE + EIA + SODIR + metocean
- **Key capability**: Autonomous field development screening
  ("What GOM deepwater fields have BSEE production data + metocean + no existing development?")
- **Key gap**: No synthesis layer; sources queried independently

### assetutilities — Shared Infrastructure Agent
- **Role**: Supporting utilities for Tier 2/3 agents
- **Agent interface**: common data pipelines, unit conversion, IO adapters
- **Key gap**: Not yet wired into the other tier-1 repos as a shared dependency

### workspace-hub — Orchestration and Vision Layer
- **Role**: Coordinates agents across repos; maintains the capability map; spawns WRK items
- **Key capability**: Cross-repo workflows
  ("Assess deepwater pipeline feasibility" → worldenergydata + digitalmodel + doris)
- **Key gap**: No workflow specs; no agent composition layer

## The Knowledge → Capability → Action Loop

```
KNOWLEDGE (WRK-309)          CAPABILITY (WRK-383/384)       ACTION (WRK items)
─────────────────────        ────────────────────────────   ────────────────────────
623K classified docs    ───▶  Standard → module mapping  ───▶  Gap WRK items (WRK-386)
Phase B: discipline,          Module registry             ───▶  Enhancement WRK items
  keywords, summary           Capability tiers                  (per standard, per module)
Phase C: domain → repo        Agent interfaces            ───▶  Cross-repo workflows
```

## Output Artefacts

1. `specs/architecture/agent-vision.md` — this document in prose form
2. `specs/architecture/capability-tiers.yaml` — structured tier definitions per repo
3. `specs/architecture/workflow-patterns.yaml` — canonical multi-repo workflow templates:
   - Fatigue assessment workflow (digitalmodel)
   - Field development screening (worldenergydata)
   - Portfolio risk analysis (assethold)
   - Deepwater installation feasibility (digitalmodel + worldenergydata)
4. Update `CLAUDE.md` repo-level context files to reference the architecture

## Implementation Steps

1. Draft `specs/architecture/agent-vision.md` incorporating:
   - Tier definitions and progression path
   - Repo role assignments
   - Knowledge → capability → action loop
   - Specific milestones per repo per tier
2. Write `specs/architecture/capability-tiers.yaml`
3. Write `specs/architecture/workflow-patterns.yaml` (4 canonical patterns)
4. Update workspace-hub CLAUDE.md to link architecture docs
5. Review and refine with user

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `specs/architecture/agent-vision.md` covers all tier-1 repos
- [ ] Capability tiers are concrete (measurable, not aspirational)
- [ ] At least 4 workflow patterns defined end-to-end
- [ ] Architecture docs linked from workspace-hub CLAUDE.md
- [ ] All future WRK items can reference `specs/architecture/` for alignment
