# Licensed Software Usage Workflow & Burden Reduction

## What
Document OrcaFlex license access workflow (TightVNC, credentials, availability) and review all licensed software (ANSYS, OrcaFlex) for usage optimization and maintenance cost reduction. Fix plaintext credential security violation.

## Why
- Engineers lack a single clear document for "How do I get OrcaFlex running?"
- Plaintext passwords committed to repo (security violation)
- No coordination protocol for shared single-seat license
- No management-facing document for license cost optimization

## Deliverables
1. OrcaFlex Usage Guide (acma-projects/admin/orcaflex/use_instructions.md)
2. Security fix: remove plaintext passwords (acma-projects/admin/acma_vpn.md)
3. Remote desktop documentation update (assetutilities/docs/sub_hardware/server_remote_desktop.md)
4. Licensed Software Review & Recommendations (acma-projects/admin/licensed_software_review.md)
5. PDF copies of key documents

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No plaintext passwords in any committed file
- [ ] Each document is standalone (printable/emailable without context)
- [ ] All tables use ASCII formatting (no mermaid, no HTML)
- [ ] use_instructions.md answers "how do I run OrcaFlex remotely?" end-to-end
- [ ] licensed_software_review.md covers OrcaFlex + ANSYS with actionable recommendations
- [ ] Way-forward table has owners and timelines for management review
- [ ] PDF copies generated for key documents
