# GIS Skills — QGIS, Google Earth Engine, Python GIS Ecosystem

## What

Create three new AI interface skills for geospatial analysis:

1. **QGIS Skill** — PyQGIS automation, headless processing (qgis_process), Processing framework algorithms, vector/raster operations, CRS handling, plugin system
2. **Google Earth Engine Skill** — ee Python API, authentication, image/collection operations, export workflows, geemap integration, common datasets (Landsat, Sentinel, GEBCO bathymetry)
3. **Python GIS Ecosystem Skill** — GDAL/OGR, Fiona, Shapely, Rasterio, GeoPandas, pyproj, Folium, xarray/rioxarray, Cartopy — the foundational libraries that underpin all GIS work

Each skill follows the 5-capability interface pattern from WRK-372: input generation, execution, output parsing, failure diagnosis, validation.

## Why

GIS capabilities are needed for offshore/marine engineering workflows — bathymetry data, pipeline routing, environmental impact assessment, coastline analysis, seabed survey processing. These tools integrate with the existing engineering skills (FreeCAD, Gmsh, OpenFOAM) for geospatially-aware analysis. QGIS was previously blocked by WRK-020 (installation); needs reassessment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] QGIS skill: PyQGIS headless automation, Processing framework, vector/raster I/O, CRS transforms, failure diagnosis
- [x] Google Earth Engine skill: ee API, authentication flows, image/collection operations, export, marine datasets (GEBCO, EMODnet)
- [x] Python GIS ecosystem skill: GDAL, Fiona, Shapely, Rasterio, GeoPandas, pyproj, format reference (GeoTIFF, GeoPackage, Shapefile, KML, GeoJSON, NetCDF)
- [x] Marine/offshore GIS context: bathymetry sources, UTM zones, WGS84, pipeline routing patterns
- [x] Each skill validated end-to-end (Phase 5 pattern from WRK-372)
- [x] Cross-program workflow: GIS data → engineering tool integration documented

## Agentic AI Horizon

- GIS is a high-leverage capability for AI agents — most geospatial operations are scriptable and repeatable
- Google Earth Engine provides planetary-scale data access that would be impossible manually
- The Python GIS ecosystem skill is foundational — used by virtually every geospatial workflow
- Shape: build now, these capabilities compound with every engineering project that needs geospatial context
