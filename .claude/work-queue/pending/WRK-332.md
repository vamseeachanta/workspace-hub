# On-bottom stability module — DNV-RP-F109 soil resistance calculations

## What

Implement pipeline on-bottom stability per DNV-RP-F109: absolute and generalised stability
methods. Soil resistance (clay/sand), hydrodynamic loading (Morison), required specific
gravity, concrete coating thickness. Output: stability check results table.

## Why

On-bottom stability is a critical pipeline design check that determines whether a pipeline
stays in place on the seabed under wave and current loading. The required concrete coating
weight directly affects installation vessel requirements and project cost. Automating this
per DNV-RP-F109 enables rapid parametric studies across environmental conditions.

## Standards

- DNV-RP-F109

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Absolute stability method: lateral and vertical force balance
- [ ] Generalised stability method: allowable displacement approach
- [x] Soil resistance: Coulomb friction (sand, mu=0.6 default)
- [x] Hydrodynamic loading: Morison equation (drag, lift, inertia coefficients)
- [x] Required submerged weight and concrete coating thickness output
- [x] Stability check results dict: load_ratio, F_D, F_L, F_I, F_R, pass/fail
- [ ] ASCII-first config input: pipe data, soil data, environmental data
- [x] Pytest coverage with worked example calculations (35 tests, all pass)
