# On-bottom stability module — DNV-RP-F109 soil resistance calculations

## What

Implement pipeline on-bottom stability per DNV-RP-F109: absolute and generalised stability
methods. Soil resistance (clay/sand), hydrodynamic loading (Morison), required specific
gravity, concrete coating thickness. Output: stability check results table.

## Why

On-bottom stability is a critical pipeline design check that determines whether a pipeline
stays in place on the seabed under wave and current loading. The required concrete coating
weight directly affects installation vessel requirements and project cost. Automating this
per DNV-RP-F109 enables rapid parametric studies across environmental conditions.

## Standards

- DNV-RP-F109

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Absolute stability method: lateral and vertical force balance
- [ ] Generalised stability method: allowable displacement approach
- [ ] Soil resistance: passive resistance for clay and sand (undrained shear strength,
      friction angle inputs)
- [ ] Hydrodynamic loading: Morison equation (drag, lift, inertia coefficients)
- [ ] Required submerged weight and concrete coating thickness output
- [ ] Stability check results table: load case, FoS, pass/fail
- [ ] ASCII-first config input: pipe data, soil data, environmental data
- [ ] Pytest coverage with published example calculations
