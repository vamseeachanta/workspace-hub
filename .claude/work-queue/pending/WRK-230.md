# WRK-230 — Session Handoff: Commit Pending Changes + Submodule Sync

**Created:** 2026-02-22
**Priority:** Medium
**Module:** workspace-hub / digitalmodel
**Tags:** git, submodule-sync, housekeeping

## Context

Session 127 (2026-02-21/22) completed QTF TOC integration for the WAMIT validation
benchmark suite. Several uncommitted changes were left in workspace-hub at exit.

## Pending Uncommitted Changes (workspace-hub)

### Must commit
1. **`.claude/memory/orcawave-lessons.md`** — `/improve` added:
   - New "OrcaWave QTF API Quirks" section
   - `loadRAOsDiffraction` first-order RAO warning in property table
2. **`.claude/skills/.ecosystem-propagated`** — minor ecosystem update (pre-existing)
3. **`.claude/work-queue/pending/WRK-129.md`** — WRK-129 progress update (pre-existing)

### Check before committing
- `specs/modules/wrk-129-orcaflex-analysis-reporting.md` — 546-line addition
  (verify this is the approved v1.4 spec or an in-progress draft before committing)

## Submodule Sync (workspace-hub pointers out of date)

The following submodules show untracked content — their local HEADs have advanced
beyond what workspace-hub records. Run `git submodule status` to confirm, then
update pointers:

- OGManufacturing, aceengineer-admin, aceengineer-website, achantas-data
- acma-projects, assethold, assetutilities, client_projects
- doris, frontierdeepwater, hobbies, pdf-large-reader
- pyproject-starter, rock-oil-field, sabithaandkrishnaestates, saipem
- sd-work, seanation, teamresumes, worldenergydata

**Note:** `digitalmodel` pointer is already correct (`e61fc266`).

## Session Accomplishments (for reference)

All digitalmodel QTF work committed and complete:
- `e61fc266` feat(qtf): integrate QTF section into benchmark report TOC
- `ded3d330` fix(qtf): 4-panel QTF-only sum-frequency layout
- `c83e9cdb` fix(semantic): BodyIncreaseRollDampingToTarget → _COSMETIC_KEYS
- All 3 QTF cases (3.1/3.2/3.3): 0 significant semantic diffs, 4-panel figure, TOC entry ✓

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory + ecosystem changes committed to workspace-hub main
- [ ] WRK-129 spec file verified and committed (or deferred if draft)
- [ ] Submodule pointers synced for all stale submodules
- [ ] `git push origin main` confirmed after commit
