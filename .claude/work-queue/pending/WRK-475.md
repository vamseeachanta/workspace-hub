# feat(marine_ops): wire Open-Meteo Marine API into weather-window module

## Objective
Enable real-time marine weather data lookups for weather-window calculations using the Open-Meteo Marine API.

## Context
Open-Meteo provides a free, no-auth JSON REST API for marine weather (Hs, Tp, wave direction, swell). This is a high-value, low-effort addition to the `marine_ops` planning capabilities.

## Plan
1. Implement an API client for Open-Meteo Marine API in `digitalmodel.marine_ops.marine_analysis`.
2. Map API response (Hs, Tp, etc.) to internal Metocean models.
3. Integrate the feed into existing weather-window calculation logic.
4. Add unit tests with mocked API responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Successful retrieval of marine weather data for arbitrary coordinates.
- Correct parsing of JSON responses into internal models.
- Weather-window logic correctly utilizes real-time data when requested.
