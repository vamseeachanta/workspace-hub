# Refine OrcaWave Benchmarks: Barge/Ship/Spar RAO Fixes + Damping/Gyradii/Km Comparison

## What
OrcaWave vs AQWA benchmarks (WRK-031 Phase 3) for barge, ship, and spar show specific DOF mismatches that need investigation and correction. Additionally, expand the comparison to include damping coefficients, gyration radii, and metacentric height (Km) distance in vectorial manner.

### Specific RAO Issues
- **Barge**: Roll and sway RAOs not matching between solvers
- **Ship**: Heave RAO not matching between solvers
- **Spar**: Overall trends are good but motion magnitudes do not follow

### Additional Comparison Dimensions
1. **Damping values**: Extract damping coefficients from both solver outputs and compare
2. **Gyration radii**: Compare radii of gyration (Kxx, Kyy, Kzz) between solver input models to ensure consistency
3. **Km distance**: Compare metacentric height (Km) in vectorial manner between solvers

## Why
Benchmark mismatches indicate either input parameter inconsistencies (mass, inertia, CoG, Km) or solver-specific behavior differences. Comparing damping, gyration radii, and Km will help isolate whether discrepancies are from input setup or solver numerics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Barge roll and sway RAOs investigated — root cause identified and corrected
- [ ] Ship heave RAO investigated — root cause identified and corrected
- [ ] Spar motion magnitudes investigated — root cause identified and corrected
- [ ] Damping coefficients extracted from both OrcaWave and AQWA outputs
- [ ] Damping comparison plots generated (per DOF, per hull)
- [ ] Gyration radii (Kxx, Kyy, Kzz) compared between solver input models
- [ ] Metacentric height (Km) compared in vectorial manner between solvers
- [ ] Updated benchmark report with corrected results and new comparison dimensions

*Source: orcawave benchmarking for barge, ship and spar need further refinements. barge roll and sway are not matching. ship: heave is not matching. spar: trends are good but the overall motions do not follow. Ensure the damping values are extracted from output for comparison. also compare gyration radii are compared between softwares. also compare the km distance in vectorial manner*
