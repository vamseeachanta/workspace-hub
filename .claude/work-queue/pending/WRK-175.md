# WRK-175: Session Start — Engineering Context Loader

## What
Auto-detect active engineering domain from WRK item tags (mooring, fatigue, riser, hull). Pre-load relevant skill catalog subset + domain-specific memory. Prevents loading 350+ skills when only ~20 are relevant.

## SME Discussion Required
- **Naval Architecture**: Which domain boundaries to use (hull/stability vs mooring vs structural)?
- **Structural Engineering**: Should design code context (API RP 2RD, DNV-ST-F101) auto-load based on WRK tags?
- **All**: How granular should domain detection be? Module-level or sub-module?

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Define domain taxonomy from existing skill categories
- [ ] Phase 2: Implement `hooks/readiness/engineering-context.sh`
- [ ] Phase 3: Test with fatigue, wall_thickness, and metocean domains
