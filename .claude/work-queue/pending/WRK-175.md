# WRK-175: Session Start — Engineering Context Loader

## What
Auto-detect active engineering domain from WRK item tags (mooring, fatigue, riser, hull). Pre-load relevant skill catalog subset + domain-specific memory. Prevents loading 350+ skills when only ~20 are relevant.

## SME Discussion Required
- **Naval Architecture**: Which domain boundaries to use (hull/stability vs mooring vs structural)?
- **Structural Engineering**: Should design code context (API RP 2RD, DNV-ST-F101) auto-load based on WRK tags?
- **All**: How granular should domain detection be? Module-level or sub-module?

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Define domain taxonomy from existing skill categories
- [x] Phase 2: Implement skill at `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/engineering-context-loader/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Phase 3: Test with fatigue, wall_thickness, and metocean domains

## Delivered
- Skill: `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/engineering-context-loader/SKILL.md`
- README: `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/engineering-context-loader/README.md`
- Domain map covers 10 domains: mooring, fatigue, riser, hull, pipeline, structural,
  cp, drilling, energy-economics/field-development, portfolio/investments
- Gemini cross-review executed skill successfully (WRK-131 context output verified)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Engineering context loader at session start reduces context pollution and makes sessions more focused — direct agent efficiency multiplier.
- Context management will be a core agent capability in 3–4 months; but building this now establishes the pattern and the domain tag taxonomy.
- **Disposition: invest now** — session efficiency tooling compounds across every engineering session; build the context loader and domain tag system now; it becomes more valuable as session complexity grows.
