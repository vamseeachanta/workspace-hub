# feat(subsea): integrate MoorDyn + MoorPy for mooring analysis

## Objective
Establish a mooring analysis capability in `digitalmodel/subsea` using the MoorDyn and MoorPy libraries.

## Context
WRK-383 identified a lack of mooring dynamics modules. MoorDyn provides lumped-mass mooring line dynamics, while MoorPy provides quasi-static design capabilities. Together they enable a full mooring analysis workflow.

## Plan
1. Add `MoorDyn` and `MoorPy` as dependencies.
2. Create `digitalmodel/subsea/mooring_analysis` module.
3. Implement wrapper for MoorPy for pre-design and quasi-static analysis.
4. Implement wrapper for MoorDyn for dynamic verification.
5. Add test cases validated against API RP 2SK scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `MoorDyn` and `MoorPy` successfully integrated.
- Ability to run both quasi-static and dynamic mooring simulations.
- Validation tests pass against standard API RP 2SK cases.
