# Run BSEE field analysis for all leases with nicknames and geological era grouping

## What
Expand the BSEE field analysis to cover all leases available in the database (not just lower tertiary). For reporting, look up field nicknames where possible and group results by geological era to provide a structured, comprehensive view of production data.

## Why
A full-scope run across all leases provides complete coverage of the BSEE database. Field nicknames improve readability for stakeholders, and geological era grouping enables geological trend analysis and comparison across different formation ages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Run analysis pipeline for all leases in the BSEE database
- [ ] Look up and map field nicknames where available
- [ ] Classify and group results by geological era
- [ ] Present results in a structured report format
- [ ] Handle leases without nicknames gracefully (use official names)
- [ ] Validate sample results against known fields for correctness
- [ ] Document any leases excluded and reasons
