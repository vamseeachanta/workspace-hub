# OrcaFlex template library skill — get canonical spec.yml by structure type

## What
Build an OrcaFlex template library skill: given a structure type (riser, mooring, hull, etc.), returns the canonical sanitised spec.yml template. Register alongside the existing OrcaFlex modular generator skill.

## Why
Sanitised templates exist (WRK-127) but have no agent-callable lookup. Agents starting a new OrcaFlex analysis currently copy manually or start from scratch. This is a zero-code-writing item — just a lookup interface over existing templates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skill callable as `get_orcaflex_template(structure_type)`
- [ ] Returns correct template for all structure types in the WRK-127 catalogue
- [ ] Registered in skill index alongside OrcaFlex modular generator skill
- [ ] Reduces new model setup time to one agent call

## Agentic AI Horizon
- High leverage, low effort — templates are done, lookup interface is the only missing piece
- Agents cannot discover unregistered templates; this makes the entire template library agent-accessible with one registration
- **Disposition: invest now** — templates done, lookup interface is trivial; highest ROI item in this batch
