# Bidirectional SSH key auth between ace-linux-1 and ace-linux-2

## What

Set up passwordless SSH in both directions between ace-linux-1 and ace-linux-2. This is a
prerequisite for WRK-287 (SSHFS network sharing) and general multi-machine workflow.

## Why

- WRK-287 SSHFS mounts require passwordless SSH for auto-mount on boot
- Manual password entry on every SSH/SCP between machines wastes time
- Bidirectional access needed: both machines must reach each other seamlessly

## Current State

- ace-linux-2 has SSH key: `/home/vamsee/.ssh/id_ed25519` (created 2026-02-21)
- ace-linux-1 is in ace-linux-2's `/etc/hosts` at 192.168.1.100
- ace-linux-2 is in ace-linux-1's `/etc/hosts` at 192.168.1.103 (confirm)
- SSH connectivity between machines: **not verified**
- Key exchange: **not done**

## Steps

### From ace-linux-2 (this machine)
1. Test SSH connectivity: `ssh vamsee@ace-linux-1 hostname`
2. Copy key to ace-linux-1: `ssh-copy-id vamsee@ace-linux-1`
3. Verify passwordless: `ssh ace-linux-1 hostname` (should return `ace-linux-1` with no prompt)

### From ace-linux-1 (remote or physical)
4. Check if SSH key exists: `ls ~/.ssh/id_*`
5. If no key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ace-linux-1"`
6. Copy key to ace-linux-2: `ssh-copy-id vamsee@ace-linux-2`
7. Verify passwordless: `ssh ace-linux-2 hostname`

### Verification
8. From ace-linux-2: `ssh ace-linux-1 'echo OK from ace-linux-1'`
9. From ace-linux-1: `ssh ace-linux-2 'echo OK from ace-linux-2'`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ace-linux-2 → ace-linux-1 SSH works without password
- [ ] ace-linux-1 → ace-linux-2 SSH works without password
- [ ] Both machines have /etc/hosts entries for each other
- [ ] SSH host keys accepted (no MITM warnings on future connects)
