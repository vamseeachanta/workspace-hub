# Investigate plugins vs skills trade-off for repo ecosystem

## What

Claude Code now offers a plugin/extension mechanism alongside (or instead of) the current skills system used throughout this repo ecosystem. Investigate the differences, trade-offs, and whether migrating to or adopting plugins makes sense.

## Why

The skills system (`.claude/skills/`) is a bespoke, well-understood pattern used across workspace-hub, codex, and gemini. If Claude's official plugin model provides significant advantages (discoverability, portability, lower maintenance overhead), it may be worth adopting — or at minimum, hybridising. Conversely, if skills offer flexibility that plugins don't, we should document why we stay with skills. The goal is an informed, documented decision, not just awareness.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document what Claude plugins are: how they're defined, installed, and invoked
- [ ] Compare plugins vs skills on: discoverability, portability, maintenance overhead, composability, agent handoff, cross-provider support (codex/gemini)
- [ ] Identify any capabilities that plugins offer that skills cannot (and vice versa)
- [ ] Produce a recommendation: adopt plugins / hybrid / stay with skills — with rationale
- [ ] Capture findings in a knowledge doc (`.claude/docs/plugins-vs-skills.md`) or equivalent
