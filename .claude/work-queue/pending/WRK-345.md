# Consolidate validators package into assetutilities

## What
Both `worldenergydata` and `assethold` carry an orphaned `validators/` top-level package
inside their `src/` directories containing `DataValidator`. Move to `assetutilities.common.validation`
as the single source of truth.

## Why
Tier-1 consistency review (2026-02-23): maintenance split risk — two copies of the same
class, neither imported from the other, will diverge. `assetutilities` is already the
shared utility layer used by all downstream repos.

## Scope
### assetutilities
- Add `DataValidator` to `src/assetutilities/common/validation.py` (new file)
- Export from `assetutilities.common`

### worldenergydata
- Remove `src/validators/` directory
- Update `pyproject.toml` include: remove `"validators*"`
- Update test: `from validators.data_validator import DataValidator`
  → `from assetutilities.common.validation import DataValidator`
- Note: `worldenergydata.marine_safety.utils.validators` is a different internal module — leave untouched

### assethold
- Remove `src/validators/` directory (not imported anywhere — fully orphaned)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `assetutilities.common.validation.DataValidator` importable
- [ ] `worldenergydata/src/validators/` deleted
- [ ] `assethold/src/validators/` deleted
- [ ] `worldenergydata` test updated; passes
- [ ] `worldenergydata` pyproject.toml include updated
- [ ] `assethold` tests pass (no impact expected)

## Notes
- `worldenergydata.marine_safety.utils.validators` (internal, at different path) is unrelated — do not touch
