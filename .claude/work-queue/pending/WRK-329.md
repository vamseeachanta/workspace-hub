# Formalise doris calculation workflow — migrate ad-hoc calcs to Python modules

## What

Doris currently has ad-hoc MATLAB/Excel-based pipeline design calculations. Migrate key
workflows to Python modules following digitalmodel's config-driven pattern. Start with wall
thickness sizing and pressure containment. Add specs/ directory and pytest coverage.

## Why

Ad-hoc calculations in MATLAB and Excel are difficult to version control, test, and reproduce.
Migrating to Python modules with config-driven input and pytest coverage brings doris in line
with digitalmodel's established pattern, enabling consistent quality, traceability, and AI
agent assistance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] doris repo structure: src/doris/ package, specs/, tests/ directories
- [ ] pyproject.toml with dependencies and test configuration
- [ ] Wall thickness sizing module: input (pressure, depth, material) -> output (minimum WT)
- [ ] Pressure containment module: burst, collapse, combined loading checks
- [ ] Config-driven input: YAML/ASCII configuration files
- [ ] Pattern follows digitalmodel's module framework (similar interface and conventions)
- [ ] Pytest coverage for all migrated calculations
- [ ] specs/ directory with design documentation
