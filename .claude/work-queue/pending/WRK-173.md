# WRK-173: Session Management Workflow Documentation

## What
Document all hooks across all 4 hook types (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PreCompact, Stop) and create a session lifecycle schematic showing the full pipeline from session start to exit.

## Deliverables
- `.claude/docs/session-lifecycle.md` — hook catalog with execution order, purpose, latency
- `.claude/docs/session-lifecycle-schematic.md` — ASCII + Mermaid schematic of full pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All 8 stop hooks documented
- [x] All 3 PreToolUse hooks documented
- [x] All 3 PostToolUse hooks documented
- [x] All 3 PreCompact hooks documented
- [x] Session start gap documented
- [x] Schematic shows signal accumulation flow
- [x] Latency estimates included
