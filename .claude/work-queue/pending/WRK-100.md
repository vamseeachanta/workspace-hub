# Run 3-Way Benchmark on Barge Hull

## What
Execute the 3-way benchmark comparison using the Barge hull (100m × 30m × 6m) as a practical offshore case.

## Why
The Barge is a common offshore structure with simple geometry but realistic dimensions. Tests solver behavior at practical scales and frequencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create unified DiffractionSpec for Barge
- [ ] Mesh: ~500-1000 panels (coarsen if needed using mesh-utilities skill)
- [ ] All 3 solvers complete successfully
- [ ] Benchmark comparison produces MAJORITY or better consensus
- [ ] Output: JSON report, HTML report, overlay plots
- [ ] Compare with Unit Box results to identify scale-dependent differences
