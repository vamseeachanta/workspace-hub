# SPM project benchmarking - AQWA vs OrcaFlex

## What
Benchmark SPM (Single Point Mooring) project analysis results between AQWA and OrcaFlex. Compare modelling approaches, results accuracy, and workflow efficiency for SPM systems across both software packages.

## Why
Understanding the differences and alignment between AQWA and OrcaFlex for SPM analysis builds confidence in results, identifies tool-specific strengths/limitations, and informs software selection for future SPM projects.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Equivalent SPM model set up in both AQWA and OrcaFlex
- [ ] Comparison of key results (motions, tensions, offsets)
- [ ] Environmental loading comparison (wave, current, wind)
- [ ] Identification of modelling differences and their impact
- [ ] Summary report with quantified differences
- [ ] Recommendations on tool selection for SPM analysis
