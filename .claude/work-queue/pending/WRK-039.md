# SPM project benchmarking - AQWA vs OrcaFlex

## What
Benchmark SPM (Single Point Mooring) project analysis results between AQWA and OrcaFlex. Compare modelling approaches, results accuracy, and workflow efficiency for SPM systems across both software packages.

## Why
Understanding the differences and alignment between AQWA and OrcaFlex for SPM analysis builds confidence in results, identifies tool-specific strengths/limitations, and informs software selection for future SPM projects.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Equivalent SPM model set up in both AQWA and OrcaFlex
- [ ] Comparison of key results (motions, tensions, offsets)
- [ ] Environmental loading comparison (wave, current, wind)
- [ ] Identification of modelling differences and their impact
- [ ] Summary report with quantified differences
- [ ] Recommendations on tool selection for SPM analysis

## Plan

**Target**: `src/digitalmodel/solvers/benchmarks/spm/`

### Existing Assets (reuse)
- `MultiSolverComparator` + `BenchmarkRunner` from WRK-031 framework
- `solvers/orcaflex/` — OrcaFlex model generation, post-processing
- `solvers/aqwa/` — **DOES NOT EXIST YET**: AQWA input generation must be created as prerequisite (see Phase 0)
- `mooring/` — mooring line models, catenary analysis

### Phase 0 — Prerequisites
- Create `solvers/aqwa/` module with AQWA input file generation capability. At minimum: AQWA batch input (.dat) file writer for coupled hydrodynamic + mooring analysis.
- **Buoy hydrodynamic data source**: run diffraction analysis on SPM buoy using OrcaWave and AQWA independently. Use each solver's own diffraction results as input to its coupled analysis, then also cross-check with swapped inputs.
- Verify ANSYS (AQWA) and Orcina (OrcaFlex) license availability and configuration on target machine
- Add fallback path if one solver is unavailable: proceed with available solver(s) and document gap

### Phase 1 — SPM Model Definition
- `spm_model.py` — Define SPM system parameters:
  - Buoy: dimensions, mass, inertia, hydrodynamic coefficients
  - Mooring: chain/wire composition, pretension, anchor locations
  - Hawser: length, stiffness, breaking load
  - Tanker: representative vessel with RAOs
  - Environment: wave spectra, current profile, wind

### Phase 2 — Equivalent Model Setup
- `spm_orcaflex.py` — Generate OrcaFlex model for SPM system
- `spm_aqwa.py` — Generate equivalent AQWA model
- Key matching requirements: identical buoy hydrodynamics, mooring stiffness, environmental loading

### Phase 3 — Run & Compare
- Execute both models for same environmental cases
- Compare: buoy motions (6 DOF), mooring tensions, hawser loads, vessel offsets
- Use `MultiSolverComparator` for automated comparison metrics

### Phase 4 — Report
- Quantified differences table per result type
- Overlay plots: time histories, statistics, exceedance curves
- Modeling difference documentation: both solvers will run time-domain coupled analysis. Document any differences in time integration scheme, mooring line theory (lumped mass vs FEM), and damping models.
- Define time-domain vs frequency-domain alignment rules where applicable
- Recommendations on tool selection for SPM analysis

### Phase 5 — Tests
- Model setup validation tests (check parameter transfer between tools)
- Result comparison metric tests

### Dependencies
- Requires both ANSYS and Orcina licenses
- SPM buoy hydrodynamic data (from AQWA/OrcaWave diffraction analysis)

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MINOR | Gemini: MINOR
- **Actions taken**:
  - Marked `solvers/aqwa/` as non-existent explicit dependency
  - Added Phase 0 with AQWA module creation prerequisite and diffraction analysis source for buoy hydro data
  - Added license verification requirement per Gemini feedback
  - Added solver fallback path if one solver unavailable
  - Clarified time-domain analysis approach and modeling difference documentation
  - Added time-domain vs frequency-domain alignment rules per Codex feedback

## Agentic AI Horizon

- AQWA vs OrcaFlex benchmarking validates the cross-solver comparison capability in digitalmodel — important for client confidence and methodology documentation.
- Benchmark execution and result comparison is well-suited for an agent to run once the infrastructure exists; the analytical judgment on discrepancies still needs human/domain SME input.
- **Disposition: do now** — benchmark infrastructure has long-term value; results inform all SPM analysis choices going forward; execute before model improvements make the specific solver comparison moot.
