# Benchmark OrcaWave vs AQWA Results

## What
Run both AQWA and OrcaWave diffraction analyses on 2-3 representative hull forms and produce a systematic comparison of results. Compare RAOs, added mass/damping coefficients, wave excitation forces, and motion responses.

## Why
Benchmarking solvers against each other builds confidence in results and identifies solver-specific behaviors. This is standard practice in hydrodynamic analysis to validate methodology and understand tool limitations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Select 2-3 hull forms (e.g., barge, semi-submersible, ship-shaped FPSO)
- [ ] Run both solvers with equivalent inputs (mesh, wave conditions, mass properties)
- [ ] Compare RAOs across all 6 DOFs for each hull
- [ ] Compare added mass and damping matrices
- [ ] Compare wave excitation forces
- [ ] Generate overlay plots (AQWA vs OrcaWave per hull per DOF)
- [ ] Summary report with discrepancy analysis and insights
- [ ] Document any solver-specific settings that affect comparisons
