# Review pdf-large-reader vs native AI agent PDF capabilities — assess continuation or deprecation

## What

pdf-large-reader was built when AI agents lacked native PDF reading. Claude and other agents
now have native PDF capabilities. Assess: (1) what pdf-large-reader does that native agents
cannot (large files >100MB, 1000+ pages, streaming), (2) continued investment plan or
deprecation decision, (3) if kept, identify unique value proposition for next WRK items.

## Why

Maintaining a tool that duplicates native AI agent capabilities is wasteful. However,
pdf-large-reader may still have unique value for edge cases (very large files, structured
extraction, batch processing) that native capabilities do not cover. This assessment ensures
resources are directed appropriately.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document current pdf-large-reader capabilities (features, file size limits, formats)
- [ ] Document current native AI agent PDF capabilities (Claude, Codex, Gemini)
- [ ] Gap analysis: what pdf-large-reader does that native agents cannot
- [ ] Decision: continue, pivot, or deprecate
- [ ] If continue: identify 2-3 WRK items for unique value proposition development
- [ ] If deprecate: migration plan for any dependent workflows
- [ ] Decision documented in specs/ with rationale
