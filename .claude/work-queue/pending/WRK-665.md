# docs(narada): OpenClaw/WhatsApp AI Agent — Replicable Workspace Asset

## Background

A complete installation guide for **Narada** (an AI agent running on the
**OpenClaw** WhatsApp gateway) was authored and currently lives at:

```
/home/vamsi/.openclaw/workspace-whatsapp-ai-group/NARADA-SETUP-GUIDE.md
```

The guide covers the full journey from an empty system to a working agent
across three parts:

**Part I — From Zero to Narada**
1. Starting from Scratch (assumptions, end goals)
2. System Setup (Node.js, pnpm, Git, Chrome, dependencies)
3. OpenClaw Installation (clone, install, build, verify)
4. Initial Configuration (API keys, .env, wizard / manual)
5. Channel Setup — WhatsApp (enable, QR pair, verify)
6. Creating Your First Agent (workspace, core files, registration)
7. Model Configuration (choose and configure models)
8. First Message & Testing (start gateway, test, debug)

**Part II — Architecture & Deep Dive**
- Full architecture diagram
- Directory structure breakdown
- Config file sections (`openclaw.json`)
- QMD memory system
- Skills catalog
- Security / permissions model

**Part III — Replication**
- Step-by-step clone guide for a GitHub assistant (or any new workspace)

**Appendix — 30-Minute Setup Checklist** (6 phases: System Prep → Install →
Config → WhatsApp → Create Agent → Launch & Test)

## What

### Phase 1 — Commit guide to workspace-hub (30 min)

Copy the guide into the repository so it is version-controlled and accessible
from any machine:

```
docs/agents/narada-openclaw-setup-guide.md
```

Strip personal identifiers (user home paths, API key examples) and replace with
generic placeholders / env-var references before committing. Run legal scan to
confirm no client references.

### Phase 2 — Create `automation/narada-openclaw` skill (1–2 h)

Path: `.claude/skills/automation/narada-openclaw/SKILL.md`

Capability sections:
- `install` — reproduce Phase I end-to-end from guide
- `add_workspace` — clone an existing agent workspace for a new channel
  (e.g., GitHub assistant variant)
- `channel_whatsapp` — QR pair, reconnect, rotate session
- `channel_github` — configure GitHub webhook channel (future)
- `model_config` — swap underlying model (Claude / GPT-4o / Gemini)
- `debug` — common failure modes: QR timeout, build errors, agent not responding
- `backup_restore` — QMD memory snapshot + restore procedure

Trigger: manual, invoked during new agent deployment or channel rotation.

Related skills: `automation/session-memory`, `agents/agent-spawning`

### Phase 3 — GitHub assistant quick-start (optional, 30 min)

Extract the "Part III: Replication" section into a dedicated file:

```
docs/agents/narada-github-assistant-quickstart.md
```

Covers only the delta from the full guide — assumes OpenClaw already installed,
focuses on workspace cloning and GitHub channel configuration.

## Why

- The guide is currently in a local home directory only — one machine wipe loses it
- A skill makes the setup reproducible by any Claude agent session on any machine
- The GitHub assistant variant is a high-value extension: turns Narada into a
  code-aware bot that responds in GitHub issue/PR comments via webhook

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `docs/agents/narada-openclaw-setup-guide.md` committed (no personal paths,
  no secrets, generic placeholders throughout)
- [ ] `.claude/skills/automation/narada-openclaw/SKILL.md` created with ≤20 line
  frontmatter; all capability sections listed above present
- [ ] `docs/agents/narada-github-assistant-quickstart.md` created (replication
  delta only, ≤2 pages)
- [ ] Legal scan passes on all three files
- [ ] Skill registered in skill index if one exists

## Notes

- Source guide: `/home/vamsi/.openclaw/workspace-whatsapp-ai-group/NARADA-SETUP-GUIDE.md`
  — copy, don't move (keep original as backup)
- WhatsApp session token persists in `.openclaw/<workspace>/session/` — keep out of
  git (add to `.gitignore` template in skill)
- API key required: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` — load from `.env`, never hardcode
- QMD memory = OpenClaw's built-in per-agent persistent memory store

## Agentic AI Horizon

Medium fit: Codex can copy + sanitise the guide and scaffold the SKILL.md.
Human review needed for the "strip personal identifiers" step and to confirm
OpenClaw URL / license before committing.
