# aceengineer-website Test Coverage Improvement

## What
Add test coverage to the aceengineer-website repository, which currently has 0% coverage. The codebase is small (4 source files, 0 tests) making this a quick win.

## Why
Even a small codebase benefits from tests to catch regressions, especially for a public-facing website. With only 4 source files, achieving 80%+ coverage is a low-effort, high-value task.

## Current State
- **Coverage**: 0%
- **Source files**: 4
- **Test files**: 0
- **Languages**: Python and JavaScript components

## Strategy
1. Set up test infrastructure (pytest for Python, appropriate framework for JS)
2. Write basic tests for each of the 4 source files
3. Cover Python components with unit tests
4. Cover JavaScript components with appropriate tests
5. Integrate into CI

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test infrastructure configured for both Python and JS
- [ ] Tests written for all 4 source files
- [ ] Python component coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] JavaScript component coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] Overall repository coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] CI pipeline reports coverage on every PR

## Notes
- Small codebase makes this a quick win -- could be completed in a single session
- Consider both Python and JS testing frameworks as the repo contains both
