# Field Development Schematic Generator

## Motivation

The Solveig image (`aker-bp-solveig-phase2-2026.avif`) shows the kind of visual
that communicates a field development architecture at a glance — subsea template
layout, flowline routing to a host, surface facility. We can't always source such
images from OGJ/operators. We need the ability to **generate them programmatically**
from field parameters.

This drives the "vision to create visuals for field development":
- Blog posts get diagrams tailored to each example (not stock photos)
- NPV calculator output page includes a schematic of the modelled development type
- Reports from WRK-164 nodal analysis show the well-to-surface flow path

## What

A Python module `digitalmodel/field_development/schematics/` that generates
field development layout diagrams as SVG (scalable, web-ready) or PNG, parameterised
from a case study catalog entry (WRK-191).

## Development Types to Support

### 1. Subsea Tieback (priority — Solveig archetype)
```
[Host Platform/FPSO]
      |
  [Flowline ~N km]
      |
[Subsea Manifold]
   /     \
[Well 1] [Well 2] ... [Well N]
```
- Host name, water depth contour, tieback distance
- Well slot count, manifold icon, umbilical run
- Scale bar, north arrow, legend

### 2. Platform Stand-Alone
- Jacket/semi/TLP silhouette with well conductors
- Satellite subsea wells with shorter tiebacks
- Export pipeline to shore/FPSO

### 3. FPSO with Spread Mooring
- FPSO vessel outline
- Mooring lines (catenary arcs)
- Subsea production system (SPS) below

## Output Targets

| Format | Use case |
|--------|
----------|
| SVG | Web (blog posts, HTML reports) — scales cleanly |
| PNG (300 dpi) | PDF reports, presentations |
| Plotly figure | Interactive (WRK-081 calculator page) |

## Technical Approach

- **Drawing engine**: `matplotlib` with `patches` for shapes, `matplotlib.patheffects`
  for depth gradients; or `svgwrite` for pure SVG output
- **Layout**: parameterised from catalog YAML — tieback distance sets x-axis scale,
  well count drives template symbol count, water depth sets seabed line depth
- **Style**: clean technical illustration style (not photorealistic) — line weights,
  depth shading (blue gradient for water column), seabed hatch, facility icons as
  simple geometric shapes

## Module Structure

```
digitalmodel/field_development/schematics/
  __init__.py
  subsea_tieback.py       # SubseaTiebackSchematic class
  platform_standalone.py  # PlatformSchematic class
  fpso_spread.py          # FpsoSchematic class
  elements/
    __init__.py
    icons.py              # Platform, manifold, well, FPSO as matplotlib artists
    annotations.py        # Scale bar, north arrow, legend, depth labels
    seabed.py             # Seabed profile with bathymetry gradient
  renderer.py             # Common render(fig, output_path, format) function
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Subsea tieback schematic from catalog YAML → SVG output
- [ ] Parameterised: well count (1–8), tieback distance, host type (semi/FPSO/jacket)
- [ ] Platform stand-alone schematic with satellite wells
- [ ] PNG export at 300 dpi
- [ ] Solveig Phase 2 example schematic generated and stored in references/
- [ ] 20+ tests (element rendering, layout math, file output)
- [ ] Plotly interactive version for WRK-081 calculator

## Reference Visual

`digitalmodel/docs/modules/references/field_development/aker-bp-solveig-phase2-2026.avif`
— use as style/content target for what the subsea tieback output should convey

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Field development schematic generator creates Python SVG/PNG diagrams for client-facing deliverables — agents producing project documentation will use this.
- Diagram generation from structured data is a well-defined coding task; the module built now becomes a persistent asset that agents invoke repeatedly.
- **Disposition: invest now** — schematic generation is a reusable capability that every field development analysis can use; build it as a skill that agents call.
