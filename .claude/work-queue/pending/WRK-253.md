# Data residence tier compliance audit and extension to assethold

## What
Audit data residence tier compliance across worldenergydata and digitalmodel after WRK-200 (naming cleanup). Extend the three-tier classification to assethold (daily_strategy, stocks, property data). Generate a machine-readable compliance report.

## Why
The three-tier strategy was implemented (WRK-097) but WRK-200 naming cleanup may have shifted tier boundaries. Assethold was never classified. Agents need to know which data tier to access for each analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Compliance audit confirms no tier violations post-WRK-200 in worldenergydata and digitalmodel
- [ ] Assethold data classified into tiers (daily_strategy, stocks, property data)
- [ ] Compliance report generated at `config/data-residence-compliance.yaml`
- [ ] Agents can query tier classification for any data source

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Foundational data governance — agents making data access decisions need to know which tier a source belongs to
- Audit is a prerequisite; extension to assethold is overdue; WRK-200 completion is a natural trigger
- **Disposition: invest now** as foundational data governance; do after WRK-200 completes
