# AI Agent Utilization Strategy

## What
Define and implement a systematic strategy for utilizing available AI agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) across the full development lifecycle: planning, architecture, implementation, testing, code review, and documentation. Establish clear role assignments, handoff patterns, and quality gates that leverage each agent's strengths.

## Why
Multiple AI agents are available (Claude Code as orchestrator, Codex CLI and Gemini CLI for cross-review) but usage is currently ad-hoc — mostly limited to cross-review of completed work. A deliberate strategy would maximize agent utilization across all phases: using agents for upfront planning validation, parallel implementation exploration, automated test generation, documentation drafting, and continuous review — not just post-hoc review.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit current agent capabilities and limitations (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI)
- [ ] Define role matrix: which agent handles which workflow phase (planning, coding, testing, review, docs)
- [ ] Document agent invocation patterns for each phase (commands, flags, input/output formats)
- [ ] Create agent delegation templates for common tasks (feature implementation, bug fix, refactor, test writing)
- [ ] Establish quality gates that require multi-agent consensus (e.g., 2-of-3 approve before merge)
- [ ] Integrate agent utilization into work queue routing (Route A/B/C agent assignments)
- [ ] Test the strategy on 2-3 real work items from the queue
- [ ] Document lessons learned and refine the strategy
