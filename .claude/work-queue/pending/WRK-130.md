# Standardize Analysis Reporting for Each OrcaWave Structure Type

## What
Create a standardized reporting framework for OrcaWave (diffraction) analysis outputs, with per-hull-type report templates. Each hull category (barge, ship, spar, semi-sub, FPSO, LNGC) gets a dedicated HTML report with consistent format: RAO plots per DOF, added mass/damping matrices, wave excitation forces, mesh quality summary, and solver comparison tables.

## Why
- Diffraction benchmark reports (barge r4, ship r1, spar r1) were built ad-hoc with custom scripts
- The r4 barge report format is the canonical template but not yet abstracted into reusable code
- Standard reports enable automated post-processing after every OrcaWave/AQWA run
- Consistent format across hull types makes cross-comparison straightforward
- Links to hull library (WRK-115) — reports should auto-reference cataloged hull metadata

## Scope
1. **Define standard diffraction output schema** — RAOs (6 DOF × N headings × N frequencies), added mass (6×6), radiation damping (6×6), wave excitation forces, mesh metadata
2. **Report template** — single-page HTML following r4 barge report convention (per-DOF 2-col grid, significance filter, vertical legends)
3. **Standard plots** — RAO amplitude/phase per DOF, added mass/damping vs frequency, wave force per heading
4. **Solver comparison** — side-by-side OrcaWave vs AQWA (vs BEMRosetta) when multiple solver results available
5. **Mesh quality section** — panel count, aspect ratio, watertight check, symmetry
6. **Report generator API** — `generate_diffraction_report(hull_id, solver_results) → HTML`
7. **Integration with hull catalog** — auto-populate hull metadata from `hull_panel_catalog.yaml`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Standard diffraction output schema defined (RAOs, matrices, forces, mesh)
- [ ] HTML report template following r4 barge canonical format
- [ ] Plotly interactive plots: RAO amplitude/phase, added mass/damping matrices, wave forces
- [ ] Solver comparison layout when multiple results available
- [ ] Mesh quality summary section with panel statistics
- [ ] Report generator callable from benchmark scripts
- [ ] At least 2 example reports generated from existing benchmark data (barge, ship or spar)
- [ ] Reports self-contained (single HTML file with embedded Plotly CDN)
