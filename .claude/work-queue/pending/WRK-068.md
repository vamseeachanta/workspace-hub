# Acquire BSEE incident investigations and INCs data

## What
Download actual BSEE incident investigation data and Incidents of Non-Compliance (INCs) from data.bsee.gov. Re-download the 15 stub Excel files from bsee.gov/stats-facts/offshore-incident-statistics. Verify URL importers work with corrected endpoints.

## Why
Current BSEE data coverage is near-zero despite having importers. The importers were pointing to wrong data endpoints (now fixed).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Download incident investigation raw data from data.bsee.gov
- [ ] Download INCSRawData.zip from data.bsee.gov
- [ ] Re-download all 17 Excel spreadsheets (replace stubs)
- [ ] Verify corrected URL importers work
- [ ] Import data into database
- [ ] Document record counts and date ranges
