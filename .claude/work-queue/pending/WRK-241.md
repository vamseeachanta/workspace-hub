# Pipeline integrity skill — chain wall thickness, parametric engine, and FFS into one callable workflow

## What
Create a "pipeline integrity assessment" skill that chains wall thickness (WRK-044/155), parametric Cartesian sweep engine (WRK-158), and FFS acceptance (WRK-156/138) into a single agent-callable workflow. Input: pipe dimensions, pressure, material. Output: wall thickness → utilisation → FFS accept/reject.

## Why
These three delivered components are disconnected silos. Together they form the key engineering deliverable for the asset integrity market. An agent should invoke end-to-end with one call.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skill chains all three modules (wall thickness, parametric engine, FFS)
- [ ] Single invocation API documented (input: pipe dimensions, pressure, material; output: wall thickness, utilisation, FFS verdict)
- [ ] FFS phase activates when WRK-156 Phase 1 ships; skill is created now with FFS step stubbed
- [ ] Tested end-to-end with at least 2 input configurations

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Core engineering skill for the asset integrity market — enables a full pipeline integrity assessment from a single agent invocation
- Wall thickness and parametric engine are complete; FFS is the missing step (WRK-156); chaining is the integration work
- **Disposition: invest now** — create skill with FFS step stubbed; activate when WRK-156 ships
