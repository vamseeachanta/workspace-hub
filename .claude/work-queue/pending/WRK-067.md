# Acquire OSHA enforcement and fatality data

## What
Download OSHA enforcement data (inspections + violations) from enforcedata.dol.gov, OSHA severe injury reports from osha.gov/severe-injury-reports, and OSHA fatality data from osha.gov/fatalities. Filter for oil & gas NAICS codes (211, 213111, 213112). Build importers in the HSE module.

## Why
Zero onshore oil & gas incident data currently exists. OSHA data covers 1973-present with daily updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Download OSHA enforcement CSVs (inspections, violations, accidents)
- [ ] Download OSHA severe injury reports CSV
- [ ] Download OSHA fatality data CSV
- [ ] Filter for oil & gas NAICS codes
- [ ] Build importer(s) in HSE module
- [ ] Import data into database
- [ ] Document record counts and date ranges

## Progress
- 2026-02-01: Acquirer code built (osha_acquirer.py, osha_importer.py, osha_fatalities_acquirer.py). DOL portal rate-limited initial download. Retry in progress.
- 2026-02-01: All 13 OSHA datasets downloaded successfully (40.6M records, 6.6GB). DOL moved downloads to enfxfr.dol.gov with date-stamped URLs. Pending: filter for oil & gas NAICS codes and run import.
