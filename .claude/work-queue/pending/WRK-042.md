# Develop long-term plan for Investments repo

## What
Create a long-term plan/roadmap for the Investments repository — defining its purpose, structure, tracking goals, and development direction.

## Why

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review current state of the Investments repo (content, structure, activity)
- [ ] Define the repo's purpose and scope
- [ ] Outline long-term goals and milestones
- [ ] Plan documented and committed to the repo
