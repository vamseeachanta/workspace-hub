# Develop long-term plan for Investments repo

## What
Create a long-term plan/roadmap for the Investments repository — defining its purpose, structure, tracking goals, and development direction.

## Why
A clear long-term plan provides direction for the repo, ensures consistent tracking and analysis, and supports informed decision-making over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review current state of the Investments repo (content, structure, activity)
- [ ] Define the repo's purpose and scope
- [ ] Outline long-term goals and milestones
- [ ] Plan documented and committed to the repo

## Plan

### Current State Assessment

The investments repo is an investment analysis and portfolio management system with substantial real content:

- **re_cre/**: 18+ commercial real estate property directories (bank, conv_store, drugstore, hotel, land, medical, mix_use, multifamily, multiplex, pharmacy, qsr, retail, re_tenx, private_investor_club, corner_lots, plus specific addresses like 159_keen_st, 412_wurtland_ave). Contains detailed underwriting, lease analysis, flood reports, auction notes, and negotiation docs. Has a Drugstore Market Report PDF.
- **re_auctions/**: Auction tracking with info.md
- **family-dollar-analysis/**: Multi-phase analysis (Houston, Texas, national) with dashboards, competitive analysis, property records, validation, and caching
- **urban-development-dashboard/**: Flask/web app with app/, data/, static/, tests/ directories and its own venv
- **dev_tools/**: Development tooling
- **src/modules/**, **src/external/**: Python source code
- **tests/**: Unit, integration, and specialized tests (buffet_negotiation)

The repo has an `.agent-os/` with a well-developed product mission, tech stack, roadmap (5 phases through 24+ months), and decisions log. The CLAUDE.md declares asset classes: CRE, multifamily, single-family, farmland, equity. Same scaffolding bloat as hobbies (`.hive-mind/`, `.swarm/`, `agents/` with only sample files).

The existing `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` already has a 5-phase plan. This work item should reconcile the existing roadmap with actual repo state.

### Phase 1: Audit CRE Content and Identify Lease Data (1 session)

1. Inventory all CRE property directories in `re_cre/` (18+ property types)
2. For each property type: identify lease agreements, terms, financial data
3. Map existing content: what lease terms, rent schedules, CAM structures, escalation clauses exist
4. Identify sensitive/client-specific data that requires redaction
5. Document findings in `investments/docs/cre-data-audit.md`

### Phase 2: Extract and Redact Lease Terms into assethold (2-3 sessions)

**Primary deliverable**: Generic lease term database in assethold for CRE analysis

1. Define generic lease term schema in `assethold/src/assethold/modules/cre/`:
   - `lease_models.py` — Pydantic models: `LeaseTerms`, `RentSchedule`, `CAMStructure`, `EscalationClause`, `TenantProfile`
   - Property types: NNN, gross, modified gross, percentage rent
   - Key fields: base rent, CAM charges, escalation rate, lease duration, options, TI allowance
2. Extract lease terms from `investments/re_cre/` property directories
3. **Redact**: Remove tenant names, specific addresses, deal-specific negotiations
4. **Generalize**: Convert specific deals into representative market-rate templates by property type
5. Store in `assethold/data/cre/lease_templates/` as YAML files (one per property type)
6. Tests: schema validation, redaction completeness check

### Phase 3: CRE Analysis Foundation in assethold (1-2 sessions)

1. Build basic CRE analysis tools using the lease term data:
   - `lease_analyzer.py` — NOI calculation, cap rate analysis, rent roll generation
   - `market_comparison.py` — Compare lease terms across property types
   - Reuse existing `multifamily/` IRR/cash flow engine patterns
2. Family Dollar analysis as template: generalize the existing `family-dollar-analysis/` into a reusable NNN retail analysis template
3. Tests for all new analysis modules

### Phase 4: Clean Up and Roadmap (1 session)

1. Remove scaffolding bloat: `.hive-mind/`, `.swarm/`, `agents/` (sample files only)
2. Simplify `CLAUDE.md` to focus on CRE/investment analysis
3. Update `investments/README.md` with purpose and quick-start
4. Write pragmatic 12-month roadmap in `investments/docs/roadmap-practical.md`

### Target Files

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Audit report | `investments/docs/repo-audit.md` |
| Updated roadmap | `investments/.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` |
| Practical roadmap | `investments/docs/roadmap-practical.md` |
| README | `investments/README.md` |

### Review Notes

**Cross-review date**: 2026-02-10

| Reviewer | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Claude Opus 4.6 | APPROVE |
| Gemini CLI | APPROVE |
| Codex CLI | NO_OUTPUT |

**Feedback incorporated**:
- Existing roadmap at `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` confirmed
- README confirmed missing
- `src/modules/` and `src/external/` are both empty (plan should note)

*Approved by user: 2026-02-10 (plan refocused on lease term extraction + redaction into assethold)*

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Investments repo long-term planning has personal value but limited ecosystem agentic boost beyond connecting to assethold analysis.
- Investment portfolio planning will be better supported by financial AI agents in 3–4 months; custom repo structuring can wait.
- **Disposition: park 3 months** — defer until assethold modules (WRK-021, WRK-022) are further along; the investments repo plan should follow from those deliverables.
