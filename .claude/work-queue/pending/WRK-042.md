# Develop long-term plan for Investments repo

## What
Create a long-term plan/roadmap for the Investments repository — defining its purpose, structure, tracking goals, and development direction.

## Why
A clear long-term plan provides direction for the repo, ensures consistent tracking and analysis, and supports informed decision-making over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review current state of the Investments repo (content, structure, activity)
- [ ] Define the repo's purpose and scope
- [ ] Outline long-term goals and milestones
- [ ] Plan documented and committed to the repo

## Plan

### Current State Assessment

The investments repo is an investment analysis and portfolio management system with substantial real content:

- **re_cre/**: 18+ commercial real estate property directories (bank, conv_store, drugstore, hotel, land, medical, mix_use, multifamily, multiplex, pharmacy, qsr, retail, re_tenx, private_investor_club, corner_lots, plus specific addresses like 159_keen_st, 412_wurtland_ave). Contains detailed underwriting, lease analysis, flood reports, auction notes, and negotiation docs. Has a Drugstore Market Report PDF.
- **re_auctions/**: Auction tracking with info.md
- **family-dollar-analysis/**: Multi-phase analysis (Houston, Texas, national) with dashboards, competitive analysis, property records, validation, and caching
- **urban-development-dashboard/**: Flask/web app with app/, data/, static/, tests/ directories and its own venv
- **dev_tools/**: Development tooling
- **src/modules/**, **src/external/**: Python source code
- **tests/**: Unit, integration, and specialized tests (buffet_negotiation)

The repo has an `.agent-os/` with a well-developed product mission, tech stack, roadmap (5 phases through 24+ months), and decisions log. The CLAUDE.md declares asset classes: CRE, multifamily, single-family, farmland, equity. Same scaffolding bloat as hobbies (`.hive-mind/`, `.swarm/`, `agents/` with only sample files).

The existing `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` already has a 5-phase plan. This work item should reconcile the existing roadmap with actual repo state.

### Phase 1: Audit and Gap Analysis (1 session)

1. Inventory all actual investment content by asset class:
   - CRE: count properties, depth of analysis per property
   - Multifamily: check if analysis engine code exists in `src/`
   - Single-family, farmland, equity: check if directories exist and have content
2. Map existing code assets: Python analysis scripts, dashboard apps, test coverage
3. Compare actual state against the Phase 0 "completed" items in `roadmap.md`
4. Identify which roadmap Phase 1 items already have partial progress
5. Document findings in `investments/docs/repo-audit.md`

### Phase 2: Reconcile and Prioritize Roadmap (1 session)

1. Review the existing `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` (5 phases, 24+ months)
2. Mark items that are partially done or have changed in priority
3. Reassess Phase 1 priorities based on actual investment activity:
   - CRE analysis tools likely highest priority (most content exists here)
   - Family Dollar analysis already advanced -- should this be formalized as a template?
   - Urban development dashboard -- assess completeness and decide if it stays or gets archived
4. Update `roadmap.md` with current status annotations

### Phase 3: Clean Up and Organize (1 session)

1. Remove scaffolding bloat (same pattern as WRK-041):
   - Evaluate `.hive-mind/`, `.swarm/`, `agents/` (sample files only), `coordination/`
   - Root-level scripts: `create-spec*.py`, `execute-tasks.py`, `slash_commands.py`
2. Simplify `CLAUDE.md` to focus on investment-specific commands and structure
3. Consolidate `src/modules/` and `src/external/` if appropriate
4. Ensure `.gitignore` covers `urban-development-dashboard/venv/`, `htmlcov/`, `.cache/`

### Phase 4: Define Long-Term Direction (1 session)

1. Decide key strategic questions:
   - Should the repo focus on CRE (where most content lives) or remain multi-asset?
   - Is the Python analysis engine actively used? Should it be enhanced or simplified?
   - Should `family-dollar-analysis/` be generalized into a reusable retail analysis template?
   - Integration with `assethold` repo: what is the current state and is it worth maintaining?
2. Write a pragmatic 12-month plan focusing on 3-5 concrete deliverables
3. Update `investments/docs/roadmap-practical.md` with the focused plan
4. Update `investments/README.md` (currently missing) with purpose and quick-start
