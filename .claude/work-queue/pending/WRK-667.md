# feat(work-queue): Strengthen Resource Intelligence Skill with Measurable Quality Impact

## What

Harden the `resource-intelligence` stage into a repeatable, skill-driven, validator-checkable process with explicit quality metrics and evidence outputs.

## Why

User gap review on WRK-624 requested revision on Resource Intelligence: confirm skill presence and demonstrate that it increases planning/execution strength instead of adding ceremony.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Confirm and document the canonical `resource-intelligence` skill usage path in work-queue flow docs
- [ ] Define measurable impact metrics (minimum):
  - [ ] plan rework reduction
  - [ ] missing-artifact reduction at claim/close
  - [ ] cross-review blocker reduction attributable to resource gaps
- [ ] Add a standard per-WRK artifact schema for resource intelligence outputs
- [ ] Add validator checks for required resource intelligence refs on new/touched WRKs
- [ ] Add HTML summary block showing resource intelligence findings and confidence
- [ ] Produce at least 3 comparison examples (before/after) demonstrating quality lift
- [ ] Cross-review with Claude, Codex, Gemini and synthesize verdict

## Notes

- This is a direct follow-on from WRK-624 user gap decision (`resource_intelligence: revise`).
- Keep implementation lightweight for authors, strict for validators.
