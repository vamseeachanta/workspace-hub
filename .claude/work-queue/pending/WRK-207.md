# WRK-207: Skill Relationship Maintenance — Bidirectional Linking as Enforced Process

## What

Formalize and enforce bidirectional skill linking so that when a skill is created
or enhanced, existing related skills are updated to reference it. Currently the
process is manual and inconsistently applied: new skills list `related_skills:` in
their own frontmatter but rarely update the existing skills they relate to.

## Why

A one-directional graph is a partial graph. If skill A lists B as related but B
doesn't list A, discovery fails from B's side — which is the entry point for
users who already know B. This directly undermines the knowledge graph (WRK-205)
because relationships must be bidirectional to enable traversal in either direction.

**Session trigger (2026-02-19)**: This was identified when linking WRK-187 and
WRK-205 — the skill ecosystem had several clusters (improve, claude-reflect,
skill-learner, knowledge-manager, skill-creator) with missing cross-links that
were all manually added during this session.

## Items

### 1. Enforce in skill-creator checklist

Already added (2026-02-19):
```
- [ ] Existing related skills updated — search for skills that overlap or compose
      with this one; add this skill to their related_skills: frontmatter
      (bidirectional linking is mandatory)
```

Make this a hard checklist item that /improve Phase 3 verifies.

### 2. /improve Phase 3 — relationship audit

When /improve runs its ecosystem review, scan for asymmetric relationships:
- Load all SKILL.md frontmatter `related_skills:` fields
- For each pair (A → B in A's related_skills), verify B → A in B's related_skills
- Flag missing back-links as improvement candidates
- Apply missing back-links automatically (score >= 0.6 since these are factual, not subjective)

### 3. Stop hook signal

When a skill is enhanced or created in a session (detectable via git diff on
`.claude/skills/`), the stop hook should emit a signal:
```json
{"type": "ecosystem", "signal": "Skill created/enhanced — verify bidirectional links", "severity": "info"}
```

This prompts /improve to run the relationship audit for the session's touched skills.

### 4. SKILLS_GRAPH.yaml edge validation (WRK-205 dependent)

Once WRK-205 delivers `SKILLS_GRAPH.yaml`, the relationship audit should cross-check
that every `related_skills:` frontmatter link has a corresponding edge in the graph,
and vice versa. Frontmatter is the source of truth; graph is derived.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] /improve Phase 3 detects and fixes asymmetric related_skills links
- [ ] Stop hook emits signal when skills are touched in a session
- [ ] skill-creator checklist item enforced (documented, not just listed)
- [ ] At least the core workspace-hub skill cluster (improve, reflect, skill-learner, knowledge-manager, skill-creator) is fully bidirectionally linked
