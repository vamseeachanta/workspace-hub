# Heriberto: Powder Room Sink Caulk for Water Drainage

## What

Have Heriberto re-caulk the powder room sink to improve water drainage and prevent
water from pooling or seeping where it shouldn't.

## Why

Current caulk is inadequate — water does not drain properly and may cause damage
over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Old caulk removed
- [ ] Fresh caulk applied around sink base/drain area
- [ ] Water drains cleanly with no pooling or seepage
