# OFFPIPE Integration Module — pipelay cross-validation against OrcaFlex

## What

Full OFFPIPE module for independent cross-validation of OrcaFlex pipelay analysis. MVP scoped to S-lay static analysis. Includes:
- OFFPIPE output file parser
- Unified pipelay schema (PipelayResults, PipeProfile dataclasses)
- OrcaFlex pipelay result extraction via OrcFxAPI (in orcaflex/ for reuse)
- Configurable tolerance-based comparison engine (relative + absolute per parameter)
- Interactive Plotly HTML benchmark reports with agreement classification
- Input deck generator (Phase 6, deferred)

## Why

OFFPIPE uses an independent beam-column FEM formulation vs OrcaFlex's lumped-mass/spring approach. This makes it the most practical tool for pipelay cross-validation — no other realistic alternative (Flexcom, Riflex, PipeLay) offers better accessibility. The user has comprehensive OFFPIPE documentation and example files to drive parser design.

## Constraints

- Phase 0 blocked until user provides OFFPIPE docs + example files + matching OrcaFlex scenario
- TDD mandatory — tests first for every phase
- Flat module structure (no sub-packages) matching diffraction pattern
- Must register in engine.py for standard YAML routing
- No mocks — real data with pytest.skip fallback

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OFFPIPE S-lay output files parsed correctly (validated against golden reference)
- [ ] OrcaFlex pipelay results extracted via OrcFxAPI
- [ ] Cross-validation comparison with configurable per-parameter tolerances
- [ ] Interactive Plotly HTML benchmark report with agreement classification (EXCELLENT/GOOD/FAIR/POOR)
- [ ] All tests pass via `uv run pytest tests/offpipe/` (TDD, no mocks, real data)
- [ ] engine.py routes `offpipe` basename correctly
- [ ] Skills created: `offpipe-analysis`, `offpipe-orcaflex-benchmark` (Phase 6)

## Implementation Notes

_Populated during processing._
