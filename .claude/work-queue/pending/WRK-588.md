# Evaluate OpenTURNS for Fatigue Reliability Module Integration

## What

Evaluate OpenTURNS (openturns.github.io) uncertainty quantification and
reliability analysis library for integration with the digitalmodel fatigue
reliability module.

## Why

OpenTURNS provides probabilistic modelling, sensitivity analysis (Sobol),
and reliability methods (FORM/SORM, Monte Carlo, subset simulation). These
are directly applicable to structural fatigue reliability assessment —
a natural complement to the existing SALib sensitivity analysis capability.

## Deliverables

- Installation test on ace-linux-1/2
- Benchmark: S-N curve reliability problem
- Comparison with SALib for overlapping functionality
- Integration recommendation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OpenTURNS installed and Python API tested
- [ ] Reliability benchmark executed (FORM/SORM on fatigue problem)
- [ ] Compared with SALib for sensitivity analysis overlap
- [ ] License compatibility confirmed (LGPL)
- [ ] Recommendation documented
