## Agentic AI Horizon

- Calendar appointment tracking is a personal admin task with no ecosystem agentic value.
- Calendar management agents will handle this autonomously; the event itself is time-critical regardless.
- **Disposition: do now** — time-sensitive calendar item; ensure the appointment is confirmed and on the calendar immediately.
