# assethold root cleanup — .agent-os/, business/, agents/, empty dirs

## Context
assethold root contains several vestigial directories from the agent-os / claude-flow era
plus business documents that should not be in a Python package repo root.

## Directories to Remove / Relocate

### 1. `.agent-os/` — REMOVE (vestigial framework)
18 subdirs: agent_learning/, agents/, cli/, commands/, context/, docs/, instructions/,
integration/, modules/, product/, progress/, resources/, standards/, sub-agents/ +
cross-repo-config.yml, prompt_config.yaml, task_summary.md, UV_ENVIRONMENT.md

Not imported by active Python source. Superseded by `.claude/skills/` architecture.
Same cleanup was done for assetutilities in WRK-344.

### 2. `business/` — MOVE to `docs/business/` or REMOVE
Contains: `biz/acq_planmatics/acq_planmatics.md`, `biz/biz_grocery/vishala_eldridge.pdf`,
`incorporation/intro.md`, `incorporation/solo_401k.pdf`

Business planning documents do not belong at a Python package root. Options:
- Move to `docs/business/` if they should remain in the repo
- Remove if no longer relevant

**Decision required**: Confirm move vs remove before executing.

### 3. `agents/` — REMOVE (empty, overlaps .claude/agents/)
Root-level `agents/` with only documentation templates. Active agent config is in
`.claude/agents/`. This directory causes confusion.

### 4. `_coding_agents/` — REMOVE (empty orphan)
Zero bytes, no content.

### 5. `bin/` — REMOVE if empty
Confirm empty, then delete.

### 6. Windows-path directory artifacts
`assethold` git status shows Windows-style path entries:
- `tests\modules\stocks\analysis\investment\results\Data\multiple_investment.csv`
- `tests\modules\stocks\analysis\investment\results\Data\single_investment.csv`
- `src\assethold\tests\test_data\analysis\Portfolio\results\Data`
Run `git status` to confirm these are directory artifacts and remove.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `.agent-os/` deleted and removed from git
- [ ] `business/` moved to `docs/business/` (or removed — confirm first)
- [ ] `agents/` removed
- [ ] `_coding_agents/` removed
- [ ] `bin/` removed (if empty)
- [ ] Windows-path directory artifacts removed
- [ ] `uv run python -m pytest tests/unit/ --noconftest -q` still passes
- [ ] Commit inside assethold, then update hub submodule pointer

## Notes
- Before removing .agent-os/, confirm no active imports: `grep -r "agent.os" src/ --include="*.py"`
- business/ decision: ask user if unsure — do NOT silently delete PDF files
