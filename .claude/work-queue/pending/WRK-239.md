# BSEE field pipeline skill — zero-config agent-callable wrapper

## What
Wrap the BSEE field pipeline (wellbore, casing, drilling, completions, interventions with FieldContext) as a named, zero-config agent-callable skill. An agent should call `bsee_field_pipeline(field_name)` and receive a full FieldReport without needing setup knowledge.

## Why
The pipeline was delivered (WRK-017) but requires too much setup knowledge to invoke autonomously. With improved agents in 3-4 months, the bottleneck will be the invocation interface, not the model capability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skill registered at `.claude/skills/eng/`
- [ ] Invocation API documented (input: field_name, output: FieldReport schema)
- [ ] Agent can call it with zero additional context
- [ ] Tested against 2 real field names

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Directly enables autonomous engineering analysis — agents can run a full BSEE field report from a single field name string
- The pipeline logic is already complete; the only gap is the invocation interface, which agents cannot bridge themselves
- **Disposition: do now** — pipeline exists, wrapper is low effort, bottleneck is interface not model capability
