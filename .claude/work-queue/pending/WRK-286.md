# Harden chore: commits — require WRK ref for multi-file changes

## What

`check-commit-msg.sh` fully exempts `chore:` commits from WRK-NNN enforcement.
This allows multi-file harness/ecosystem work to bypass the WRK gate. This
session committed CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, CRLF fixes, and submodule
updates all under `chore:` without any WRK item.

## Plan (Route A)

Modify `check-commit-msg.sh`:
- `chore:` with ≤ 3 files changed → still exempt (single-touch housekeeping)
- `chore:` with > 3 files changed and no WRK-NNN → warn (non-blocking)
- Add note in AGENTS.md Policies bullet clarifying `chore:` scope

Use `git diff --cached --name-only | wc -l` to count staged files.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single-file `chore:` commits pass without WRK ref
- [ ] Multi-file (>3) `chore:` commits without WRK ref print a non-blocking warning
- [ ] Multi-file `chore:` commits WITH WRK ref pass silently
- [ ] Existing `feat/fix/refactor` blocking behaviour unchanged
- [ ] Warning message points to `.claude/work-queue/pending/`

## Implementation Notes

Threshold of 3 files covers: single submodule pointer update, single config
tweak + its test, or a two-file rename. Anything broader is tracked work.
