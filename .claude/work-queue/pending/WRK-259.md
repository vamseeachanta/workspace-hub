# BSEE Field Economics Case Study — Calibrated NPV/IRR with Cost Data Foundation

## What
Rebuild the BSEE field production data analysis case study with calibrated cost data (WRK-019) and cost calibration refinements (WRK-171). Creates an HTML page showing realistic field economics with NPV/IRR calculations, decline curve analysis, and Buckskin mooring cost context.

## Why
WRK-153 was superseded because executing it with proxy-cost estimates would produce low-confidence output requiring rework. This successor item defers execution until cost data foundations are stable, ensuring a high-quality, durable case study that requires no revision.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cost data from WRK-019 and calibration from WRK-171 integrated into case study
- [ ] HTML case study page generated with NPV/IRR workflow visualization
- [ ] Decline curve module (WRK-077, delivered) and Buckskin analysis (WRK-024, delivered) properly leveraged
- [ ] No proxy estimates — all figures based on calibrated foundation data

## Notes
- Depends on WRK-019 (cost data foundation) and WRK-171 (cost calibration)
- Leverage existing decline curve module and Buckskin analysis
- Original planning context: WRK-078 (never executed), WRK-146/WRK-148 (related studies)
