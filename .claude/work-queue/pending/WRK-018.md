# Extend BSEE field data pipeline to other regulatory data sources

## What
Adapt the streamlined BSEE field data analysis pipeline (WRK-017) to work with equivalent data from other regulatory bodies and jurisdictions:
- **Texas Railroad Commission (RRC)**: onshore and state waters Texas
- **Norway (NPD/Sodir)**: Norwegian Continental Shelf
- **Mexico (CNH/SENER)**: Mexican offshore and onshore
- **Brazil (ANP)**: Brazilian pre-salt and conventional
- Other sources as identified

For each source, implement the same analysis domains: wellbore counts, well path data, casing program schematics, drilling/completion activities, and intervention activities — adapted to the data formats and fields available from each regulator.

## Why
The BSEE pipeline covers US federal offshore only. Extending to other jurisdictions provides a global view of field data, enables cross-regional benchmarking, and maximizes the value of the analysis framework by reusing the pipeline architecture across data sources.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inventory available data from each target source (RRC, NPD, CNH, ANP)
- [ ] Map data fields from each source to the common pipeline schema
- [ ] Implement data ingestion adapters per source
- [ ] Wellbore, well path, casing, drilling, completion, intervention analysis for each source
- [ ] Handle source-specific differences (naming conventions, units, data gaps)
- [ ] Unified query interface: same input parameters work across all sources
- [ ] Cross-source comparison capability (e.g., Gulf of Mexico vs. North Sea)
- [ ] Document data availability and limitations per source
- [ ] Validate outputs against known fields in each jurisdiction

*Source: based on bsee field data pipeline, implement the same pipelines for other data sources (rail road commission, norway, mexico, brazil etc.)*
