# Extend BSEE field data pipeline to other regulatory data sources

## What
Adapt the streamlined BSEE field data analysis pipeline (WRK-017) to work with equivalent data from other regulatory bodies and jurisdictions:
- **Texas Railroad Commission (RRC)**: onshore and state waters Texas
- **Norway (NPD/Sodir)**: Norwegian Continental Shelf
- **Mexico (CNH/SENER)**: Mexican offshore and onshore
- **Brazil (ANP)**: Brazilian pre-salt and conventional
- Other sources as identified

For each source, implement the same analysis domains: wellbore counts, well path data, casing program schematics, drilling/completion activities, and intervention activities — adapted to the data formats and fields available from each regulator.

## Why
The BSEE pipeline covers US federal offshore only. Extending to other jurisdictions provides a global view of field data, enables cross-regional benchmarking, and maximizes the value of the analysis framework by reusing the pipeline architecture across data sources.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inventory available data from each target source (RRC, NPD, CNH, ANP)
- [ ] Map data fields from each source to the common pipeline schema
- [ ] Implement data ingestion adapters per source
- [ ] Wellbore, well path, casing, drilling, completion, intervention analysis for each source
- [ ] Handle source-specific differences (naming conventions, units, data gaps)
- [ ] Unified query interface: same input parameters work across all sources
- [ ] Cross-source comparison capability (e.g., Gulf of Mexico vs. North Sea)
- [ ] Document data availability and limitations per source
- [ ] Validate outputs against known fields in each jurisdiction

## Plan

**Target**: `src/worldenergydata/bsee/pipeline/adapters/` (nested under WRK-017's pipeline directory; if pipeline is later generalized to be source-agnostic, refactor `bsee/pipeline/` to top-level `pipeline/` with `bsee/` as the first adapter)

### Phase 1 — Inventory Data Availability
- RRC (Texas): production data, completion reports (publicly available via RRC query system). Note: casing data and intervention data are not in standard public downloads; completion data is limited
- NPD/Sodir (Norway): FactPages API (already have `sodir/` module with forecasting). Full coverage expected across all 6 domains
- CNH (Mexico): public production data (Ronda/CNH portal). Note: well-level casing/completion data availability is uncertain
- ANP (Brazil): ANP open data portal (production, wells, concessions). Note: casing program details may not be publicly available
- **Data availability matrix**: For each source, produce a mapping of the 6 analysis domains (wellbore, well path, casing, drilling/completion, intervention, production) to available/partial/unavailable. Partial and unavailable domains return empty DataFrames with documented reasons

### Phase 2 — Common Schema
- `common_schema.py` — Unified field pipeline schema that maps to WRK-017 `FieldContext`
- Adapter interface: `def adapt(source_data) -> FieldContext`
- Handle source-specific units (metric vs imperial), naming conventions, data gaps
- **Canonical units**: Common schema uses SI units (meters, cubic meters, kilograms). Each adapter's `adapt()` method converts source units to SI on ingestion. Unit conversion functions live in `pipeline/units.py`

### Phase 3 — Per-Source Adapters
- `rrc_adapter.py` — Texas RRC data ingestion
- `sodir_adapter.py` — Wire existing sodir module into pipeline (already has data loaders)
- `cnh_adapter.py` — Mexico CNH data ingestion
- `anp_adapter.py` — Brazil ANP data ingestion

### Phase 4 — Cross-Source Analysis
- `multi_source_query.py` — Accepts field name + optional source filter, dispatches to matching adapter(s). Same input parameters work across all sources
- `benchmarking.py` — Computes comparable metrics (recovery factor, drilling efficiency, water depth distribution) across sources. Output: structured comparison DataFrame + Plotly visualization
- Cross-regional benchmarking (GoM vs North Sea vs Brazil pre-salt)

### Phase 5 — Testing
- Unit tests per adapter with fixture data
- Integration test: query Troll field (Sodir), a well-known RRC field, and validate output schema matches `FieldContext`
- Minimum 80% coverage on new adapter code

### Dependencies
- Blocked by WRK-017 (BSEE pipeline must be complete first as template)

### Review Notes

- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR
- **Actions taken**:
  - Added per-source data availability notes to Phase 1 (RRC casing/intervention gaps, CNH/ANP uncertainty)
  - Added data availability matrix requirement to Phase 1 (6 domains mapped to available/partial/unavailable per source)
  - Added Phase 5 for testing: unit tests per adapter, integration tests with known fields, 80% coverage target
  - Fixed target path from `src/worldenergydata/pipeline/adapters/` to `src/worldenergydata/bsee/pipeline/adapters/` to align with WRK-017
  - Expanded Phase 4 with concrete deliverables: `multi_source_query.py` and `benchmarking.py`
  - Added canonical unit standard (SI) to Phase 2 with `pipeline/units.py` for conversion functions
