# feat(OGManufacturing/structural): Implement ASTM A131 — ASTM A131 (2004) Std Specification for Structural 

## Standard
- **Standard**: ASTM A131
- **Full title**: ASTM A131 (2004) Std Specification for Structural Steel for Ships
- **Domain**: structural
- **Document path**: `/mnt/ace/0000 O&G/0000 Codes & Standards/ASTM/ASTM A131/ASTM A131 (2004) Std Specification for Structural Steel for Ships.pdf`

## What

Implement engineering calculations and data models from **ASTM A131**
in the `OGManufacturing` repository, module `structural`.

This standard was identified in Phase C/E of WRK-309 (Document Intelligence)
as a gap — the document exists on the drives but its content has not been
implemented in the target repo.

## Why

**ASTM A131** is a key industry standard in the `structural` domain.
Implementing its calculations enables agents and engineers to perform
rigorous code-compliant analysis directly from the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core calculations / design checks implemented with unit tests
- [ ] Input validation at parameter boundaries
- [ ] Docstring cites the standard clause/equation numbers
- [ ] Example usage verified against standard worked example (if available)
- [ ] Cross-review passed via `scripts/review/cross-review.sh`
