# Abstract E4/E5 FST CP Documents to .md

## What

WRK-276 processed 9 of 11 planned sources. E4 and E5 (FST documents added to WRK-276
scope after the agent was launched) were not abstracted. This WRK completes those two.

## Sources

### E4 — FST CP Design Philosophy (21 pages, PDF)

```
acma-projects/B1522/ctr-2/data/350106-SC-EN-003-SD-000XXX_B_Technical Note - FSTs CP System Design Philosophy_VA.pdf
```

- Standard: **DNV-RP-B401 May 2021** (primary) + ABS GN Ships Dec 2017 (secondary)
- Also references: CSA Z662 9th ed. 2023, CSA EXP276.2 2019, BS EN 16222 Oct 2012,
  BS EN 12496, NACE SP0108, NACE AMPP SP0176 June 2022
- Structure: FST (Floating Storage Terminal) hull — SACP vs ICCP vs hybrid comparison
- Client identifiers to strip: 350106, Woodfibre, WLNG, McDermott, MDR, Wood (engineering)
- Output: `calc-010-dnv-b401-2021-fst-design-philosophy.md`
- Note: Appendix 1 contains an example CP calculation — extract this as cfg inputs

### E5 — FST-1 & FST-2 CP Specification (31 pages, PDF)

```
acma-projects/B1522/ctr-2/rpt/350106-SC-EN-022-SD-000051, FST-1 and FST-2 Cathodic Protection Specification rB1.pdf
```

- Standard: **ABS GN Ships Dec 2017** (primary)
- Structure: FST-1 and FST-2 hull — anode design section 4.4 with explicit calc tables
- Appendix D = CTR2-CP Calculation RB1 (same as E1/E2 Excel calcs)
- Client identifiers to strip: 350106, Woodfibre, WLNG, McDermott, Alan C. McClure
  Associates, Deyuan, FST-1, FST-2
- Note: "FST-1" and "FST-2" can appear as engineering context (type of structure) if
  abstracted as "FST Hull 1" and "FST Hull 2" with no project linkage
- Output: `calc-011-abs-gn-ships-2017-fst-cp-specification.md`

## Output Location

```
digitalmodel/docs/domains/cathodic_protection/examples/
  calc-010-dnv-b401-2021-fst-design-philosophy.md
  calc-011-abs-gn-ships-2017-fst-cp-specification.md
```

## Output Format (matching existing calc-001 through calc-009 pattern)

Each .md must have:
- YAML frontmatter: `standard`, `edition`, `structure_type`, `source_type`, `discipline`
- `## Input Parameters` table: parameter, symbol, value, unit, notes
- `## Calculation Results` table (if explicit results in source)
- `## Python cfg dict` with all real values populated
- `## Code Validation` section: `CathodicProtection().router(cfg)` call
- `## Gaps Found` section if any methodology not in cathodic_protection.py

## Key Points for E4

- E4 is primarily a design philosophy document (comparison), not a standalone calc.
  Abstract the Appendix 1 example calculation as the cfg inputs.
- DNV-RP-B401 2021 is the primary code — first instance in our library.
  Document any 2021-specific inputs that differ from B401-2011 (e.g. Category II coating).
- If Appendix 1 has insufficient detail for a cfg dict, create a representative cfg from
  the philosophy document's stated design parameters (FST hull area, design life, etc.)

## Key Points for E5

- Section 4.4 (anode calculations) is the primary extraction target.
- Section 4.5 has anode dimensions, weights, and count — cross-check with 4.4.
- Appendix D (= E1/E2 Excel) confirms linkage between specs; note this in the .md.
- The ABS methodology for E5 should produce a cfg consistent with calc-001
  (which is also ABS FST hull from E1/E2 Excel) — document any differences.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `calc-010-dnv-b401-2021-fst-design-philosophy.md` created with B401-2021 standard header
- [ ] `calc-011-abs-gn-ships-2017-fst-cp-specification.md` created with ABS Ships header
- [ ] Both cfg dicts have all engineering values from source (no placeholder values)
- [ ] Legal scan passes: no E4/E5 identifiers in output files
- [ ] `## Gaps Found` documented for any methodology not in cathodic_protection.py
