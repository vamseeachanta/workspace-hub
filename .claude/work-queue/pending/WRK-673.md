# test(review): enforce Resource Intelligence evidence for orchestrator reruns

## Problem

The orchestrator comparison in WRK-656 continues to skip the Resource Intelligence stage when WRK-669/670/671 run, so the WRK-624 contract is only partially exercised. Because WRK-624 does not auto-propose this follow-up, we must add a manual item that ensures a lightweight RI validation runs before claiming any future orchestrator replay.

## What

Build a Resource Intelligence checkpoint that executes before rerunning any orchestrator WRK. The checkpoint should use the existing `resource-intelligence` skill to generate or verify `resource-pack.md`, `resources.yaml`, `sources.md`, etc., record the P1/P2/P3 gap ranking, and confirm a legal scan. Tie the output to the orchestrator assets (e.g., copy to `assets/WRK-669/resource-pack.md` before each rerun) so the comparison table can cite concrete RI evidence instead of saying “skipped.”

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Skill invocation

- Run `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/resource-intelligence/SKILL.md` with the current repo context and gather the required artifact set.
- Document the gap ranking, user pause/release decisions, and legal scan results inside `assets/WRK-669/` (and later `assets/WRK-670/`, `assets/WRK-671/` if rerun).

### Phase 2 — Artifact propagation

- Copy the validated resource pack into each orchestrator asset directory before rerunning the orchestrator.
- Add references to the RI artifact paths in `claim-evidence.yaml` and `wrk-656-orchestrator-comparison` so resource intelligence is explicitly documented.

### Phase 3 — Validator record

- Rerun `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py` after the orchestrator rerun and include the updated resource-intelligence evidence in the output summary.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Resource Intelligence artifacts (`resource-pack.md`, `resources.yaml`, etc.) exist in at least one orchestrator asset folder and link back to the skill.
- [ ] Gap ranking (P1/P2/P3) and legal scan results are recorded for that run in the asset directory and the comparison HTML.
- [ ] `claim-evidence.yaml` references the RI artifact paths so the validator sees the stage output before the plan gate.
- [ ] The orchestrator comparison now marks the RI stage as covered (pass or waived with explicit note) rather than skipped.

## Evidence

- `.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-669/resource-pack.md`
- `assets/WRK-656/wrk-656-orchestrator-comparison.html`
- `.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-669/resources.yaml`
- `.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-669/legal-scan.md`
- `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-669` (with RI noted)

## Outcome

Every orchestrator rerun will now exercise Resource Intelligence, bringing the meta comparison fully into alignment with WRK-624.
