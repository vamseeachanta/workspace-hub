# feat(frontierdeepwater): Engineering AI Demo — System Prompts + Knowledge Base (Day 1)

## What

Set up the Day 1 foundation for the engineering AI demo:

1. **System prompts** — save the two discipline-specific prompts into the correct repo paths:
   - `ai-initiatives/prompts/rigid_jumper_assistant.md` (SME1 — rigid jumpers/spool pieces)
   - `ai-initiatives/prompts/pipeline_assistant.md` (SME2 — subsea pipelines)
   Both prompts are drafted in `~/Downloads/ai_initiatives_1week_roadmap.md` — extract and save.

2. **Knowledge base markdown files** — create the 4 code-reference files:
   - `ai-initiatives/knowledge/api_2rd_reference.md` — API 2RD design clauses summary
   - `ai-initiatives/knowledge/dnv_os_f201_reference.md` — DNV-OS-F201 dynamic risers
   - `ai-initiatives/knowledge/dnv_os_f101_reference.md` — DNV-OS-F101 submarine pipelines
   - `ai-initiatives/knowledge/dnv_rp_c203_fatigue.md` — S-N curves, SCF tables
   - `ai-initiatives/knowledge/api_579_ffs_reference.md` — FFS Part 4/5/9/12 summary
   Focus: machine-readable format (tables, numbered clauses) for reliable AI retrieval.

3. **Folder scaffold** — create `ai-initiatives/` directory structure per WORK_ITEM.md:
   ```
   ai-initiatives/
   ├── prompts/
   ├── knowledge/
   ├── demo/
   └── pilot/
   ```

4. **Validation** — test 5 questions per discipline using the system prompts to verify
   code reference accuracy before marking done.

## Why

The system prompts are the core of the demo — they determine whether AI answers are
grounded in the right codes and domain context. Getting them right on Day 1 sets the
quality floor for everything that follows. The knowledge base files give the AI
additional context for accurate clause citations without requiring proprietary uploads.

## Status Note

~30% done: prompt content is drafted in `~/Downloads/ai_initiatives_1week_roadmap.md`.
Remaining work is to place files, create knowledge base markdown, and validate Q&A.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `ai-initiatives/prompts/rigid_jumper_assistant.md` created with full system prompt
- [ ] `ai-initiatives/prompts/pipeline_assistant.md` created with full system prompt
- [ ] 4 knowledge base markdown files created under `ai-initiatives/knowledge/`
- [ ] `ai-initiatives/WORK_ITEM.md` moved from `~/Downloads/` into repo
- [ ] 5 test questions per discipline validated against system prompt (outputs documented)
- [ ] No client proprietary data in any file — public codes/standards only
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Agentic AI Horizon

High fit for Codex: all deliverables are file creation tasks with clear content sources.
The system prompts are already written — this is primarily file placement + knowledge
base structuring. Validation Q&A requires Claude (conversational).

## Session Note (2026-02-27)

Brochure complete (`specs/client-demos/brochure-client1-rigid-jumper-pipeline.pdf`)
and pitch email ready (`pitch-email-client1-rigid-jumper-pipeline.md`).

**This WRK item is the critical path to a live demo.** Sales collateral is ready to send;
demo cannot be run until system prompts, knowledge base, and calc templates in this item
are built. Recommend starting here immediately. Assign to Codex for file creation;
Claude validates engineering accuracy of system prompt outputs.
