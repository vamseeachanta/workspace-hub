# Create capability map — file formats, workflow pipelines, interoperability matrix

## What

Create comprehensive documentation mapping how all installed open source engineering programs
work together: file format compatibility, workflow pipelines (CAD → Mesh → Solve →
Post-process), import/export chains, and Python automation potential. This is the "glue"
document that makes the whole suite usable as an integrated system.

## Why

Having programs installed is not enough — engineers need to know which tool feeds into which,
what file formats bridge them, and where format conversion is needed. Without this map,
workflows are discovered by trial and error.

## Dependency

**Blocked by WRK-290 + WRK-291** — need all programs installed to verify actual compatibility.

## Deliverables

### 1. File Format Compatibility Matrix
Programs × formats table showing read/write/convert support:

```
         | STEP | IGES | STL | BREP | OBJ | Gmsh(.msh) | OpenFOAM | VTK | CGNS | INP(Abaqus)
---------|------|------|-----|------|-----|-------------|----------|-----|------|------------
Blender  |  ?   |  ?   |  ?  |  ?   |  ?  |      ?      |    ?     |  ?  |  ?   |     ?
FreeCAD  |  ?   |  ?   |  ?  |  ?   |  ?  |      ?      |    ?     |  ?  |  ?   |     ?
Gmsh     |  ?   |  ?   |  ?  |  ?   |  ?  |      ?      |    ?     |  ?  |  ?   |     ?
OpenFOAM |  ?   |  ?   |  ?  |  ?   |  ?  |      ?      |    ?     |  ?  |  ?   |     ?
ParaView |  ?   |  ?   |  ?  |  ?   |  ?  |      ?      |    ?     |  ?  |  ?   |     ?
CalculiX |  ?   |  ?   |  ?  |  ?   |  ?  |      ?      |    ?     |  ?  |  ?   |     ?
(FEA 2)  |  ?   |  ?   |  ?  |  ?   |  ?  |      ?      |    ?     |  ?  |  ?   |     ?
meshio   |  ?   |  ?   |  ?  |  ?   |  ?  |      ?      |    ?     |  ?  |  ?   |     ?
```

### 2. Workflow Pipeline Diagrams
Document common engineering workflows end-to-end:

- **CFD pipeline**: FreeCAD → Gmsh → OpenFOAM → ParaView
- **Structural FEA**: FreeCAD → Gmsh → CalculiX → ParaView
- **Hydrodynamic BEM**: FreeCAD/Blender → BemRosetta → ParaView
- **Thermal analysis**: FreeCAD → Gmsh → Elmer/Code_Aster → ParaView
- **Visualization**: Any solver → VTK/OpenFOAM format → ParaView/Blender

### 3. Integration Gap Analysis
- Which tool-to-tool connections require format conversion?
- Where is `meshio` needed as a bridge?
- Any dead-ends (programs that don't connect to the rest)?

### 4. Python Automation Map
- Which programs support Python scripting natively?
- What Python libraries extend them (PyFoam, meshio, pyvista)?
- Can workflows be automated end-to-end via Python?

### Output Location
`docs/research/engineering-capability-map.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File format compatibility matrix completed (verified by actual import/export tests)
- [ ] At least 4 workflow pipelines documented end-to-end
- [ ] Integration gap analysis identifying any conversion needs
- [ ] Python automation potential documented per program
- [ ] Document written to `docs/research/engineering-capability-map.md`
- [ ] At least one workflow tested end-to-end (e.g., FreeCAD → Gmsh → OpenFOAM → ParaView)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Capability mapping is high-leverage — multiplies value of every installed tool
- Document becomes reference for future assignments and projects
- Automatable workflows identified here become scripted pipelines later

## Machine Availability Notes

| Program | ace-linux-2 | acma-ansys05 | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| BemRosetta | No (needs U++ compile) | **Available** | Use acma-ansys05 for BEM work |
| OpenFOAM | Installed | TBD | |
| FreeCAD | Installed | TBD | |
| Blender | Pending | TBD | |
| Gmsh | Pending | TBD | |
| ParaView | Pending | TBD | |
