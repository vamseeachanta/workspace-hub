# Verify AQWA and OrcaWave Solver Installations

## What
Verify that AQWA (via ANSYS) and OrcaWave (via OrcFxAPI) are properly installed and licensed on the target machine for the 3-way benchmark.

## Why
Both solvers require commercial licenses. Before running the benchmark, we need to confirm licenses are valid and executables are accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AQWA solver (`aqwa_solve`) accessible and licensed
- [ ] OrcaWave accessible via OrcFxAPI Python binding
- [ ] Both solvers can run a simple test case (unit box)
- [ ] Document license expiry dates and any restrictions
- [ ] Update benchmark config with solver paths if needed
