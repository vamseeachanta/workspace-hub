# Auto-Fetch IACS Blue Book Unified Requirements Updates

## What

Create a skill or scheduled script that monitors iacs.org.uk/publications
for new or updated Unified Requirements and Unified Interpretations,
maintaining standards currency.

## Why

The complete IACS Blue Book is freely downloadable — all URs and UIs from
all classification societies. Automated monitoring ensures the ecosystem
stays current with rule changes (e.g., UR E26/27 2024 cybersecurity).

## Deliverables

- Script/skill that checks for UR updates
- Notification or log when new versions detected
- Downloaded UR index with version tracking

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] IACS publications page parsed for UR list
- [ ] Version tracking for each UR document
- [ ] Change detection: new/updated URs flagged
- [ ] Download of updated documents
- [ ] Integration into standards reference pipeline
