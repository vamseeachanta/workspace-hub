# feat(client2): Engineering AI Demo — Diffraction Workflows + Plate FFS Calcs + GoA Data + Demo Package

## What

Days 2–5 deliverables for Client 2 engineering AI demo.

### Calculation Templates (Day 2)

**Diffraction analysis templates:**
- `demo/calc_diffraction_panel_model_setup.md` — AQWA/WAMIT model conventions prompt:
  panel mesh requirements (8 panels per wavelength min), symmetry planes, free surface,
  waterplane area check, zero-speed vs forward speed; typical RAO output format
- `demo/calc_rao_interpretation.md` — RAO extraction prompt: peak period identification,
  heading matrix coverage, cancellation frequencies, cross-coupling terms (heave/pitch)
- `demo/calc_qtf_second_order.md` — QTF usage: difference-frequency loads for mooring
  low-frequency response; sum-frequency for TLP/spar springing; Newman's approximation
  when full QTF not available

**Plate FFS calculation templates:**
- `demo/calc_plate_ffs_part4_metal_loss.md` — API 579-1 Part 4 for plate: average
  measured thickness vs minimum required; RSF_a screening; Level 1 vs Level 2 distinction
  for plates (no hoop stress — limit load governs); MFFL (minimum future flaw limit)
- `demo/calc_plate_ffs_part8_distortion.md` — Part 8 shell distortions: peaking/angular
  misalignment in welds, out-of-roundness; equivalent stress from distortion; buckling
  interaction check for stiffened plates
- `demo/calc_plate_ffs_part9_cracks.md` — FAD approach for crack-like flaws:
  K_r vs L_r diagram; BS 7910 Level 2B; fracture toughness input (K_mat or J_mat);
  fatigue crack growth projection (Paris law); remaining life calculation

**GoA analysis templates:**
- `demo/calc_goa_seismic_check.md` — API RP 2EQ spectral analysis: platform period,
  base shear, OLE/CLE/ALE limit states; pushover capacity check
- `demo/calc_goa_extreme_metocean.md` — 100-yr GoA wave/current/wind parameters;
  comparison with GoM (typically harsher wave heights, lower Hs for ice-dominated zones);
  API RP 2N ice loading: first-year ridges, multi-year ice pressure, ice crushing force

### Multi-Step Workflows (Day 4)

**Diffraction-to-structural load workflow:**
File: `demo/workflow_diffraction_to_structural.md`
1. Input: water depth, vessel/structure dimensions, wave environment (Hs, Tp, heading)
2. Step 1 → panel model adequacy check (mesh density for peak period)
3. Step 2 → RAO interpretation (identify governing responses by heading)
4. Step 3 → combined load derivation (wave + wind + current for governing sea state)
5. Step 4 → structural utilisation flag (member/joint check indication)
6. Output: summary table — governing headings, load cases for detailed structural check

**GoA FFS decision workflow:**
File: `demo/workflow_goa_ffs_decision.md`
1. Input: inspection findings (wall loss % / crack dimensions / distortion mm)
2. Step 1 → GoA environment severity classification (ice zone, seismic zone, metocean)
3. Step 2 → FFS Level 1 screening (API 579-1 plates)
4. Step 3 → remaining life at GoA corrosion rate
5. Step 4 → re-inspection interval recommendation (BSEE GoA ops environment)
6. Output: FFS verdict + GoA-specific inspection schedule

### Maritime Legal Case Templates (Day 4)

**Casualty investigation analysis:**
- `demo/maritime_casualty_analysis.md` — prompt template for reviewing MAIB/NTSB/USCG
  reports: extract contributing factors → ISM Code failures → root-cause hierarchy;
  sample: parse a MAIB report section and output structured findings table
- `demo/maritime_statistical_context.md` — prompt using `worldenergydata.MAIBLoader` +
  `NTSBMarineLoader` (WRK-320): "find comparable incidents for vessel type X / failure
  mode Y" → precedent table with dates, vessel types, outcomes, regulatory citations

**Expert witness support:**
- `demo/expert_witness_report_template.md` — structured technical report for legal:
  scope of appointment, methodology, engineering findings, opinion (standard of care),
  limitations; Daubert-compliant framing; deposition Q&A prep prompt
- `demo/liability_framing_prompt.md` — translate engineering findings into
  legal causation language: "the failure of [component] was a proximate cause of...
  consistent with / inconsistent with the standard of care because..."

**Maritime legal decision workflow:**
File: `demo/workflow_maritime_legal_analysis.md`
1. Input: incident description (vessel type, operation, casualty type, jurisdiction)
2. Step 1 → applicable regulatory framework (USCG CFR / MAIB / IMO)
3. Step 2 → ISM Code non-conformity screen (safety management system failures)
4. Step 3 → comparable incident precedents (MAIB/NTSB database query)
5. Step 4 → standard of care assessment (industry practice vs regulatory requirement)
6. Step 5 → damages estimation framework (limitation of liability, P&I coverage)
7. Output: case analysis memo outline with evidence gaps flagged

### BSEE GoA Data Prompts (Day 4)
File: `demo/goa_bsee_data_queries.md`
- GoA active leases, historical platforms (Cook Inlet focus)
- Environmental study requirements for GoA OCS projects
- Seismic hazard data for GoA vs GOM structural design
- Ice zone classification per USCG/BSEE GoA regulations

### Demo Package (Day 5)
File: `demo/demo_script_client2.md`
- 15-20 min flow: diffraction overview → plate FFS walkthrough → GoA live data query
- 3 "wow" moments: QTF second-order loads, plate crack FAD diagram, GoA vs GOM comparison
- FAQ: "How does AI handle site-specific GoA conditions?" — BSEE data integration demo

## Why

Diffraction workflows + FFS for plates + GoA is a high-value combination for offshore
structural integrity work that is typically very time-intensive (multi-day model setup,
manual code checks). The GoA angle is differentiated — most AI demos focus on GoM.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 3 diffraction templates with AQWA/WAMIT conventions and sample I/O
- [ ] 3 plate FFS templates (Part 4/8/9) with worked examples
- [ ] 2 GoA-specific calc templates (seismic + metocean) with sample parameters
- [ ] Diffraction-to-structural workflow prompt chain documented
- [ ] GoA FFS decision workflow documented
- [ ] BSEE GoA data query prompts tested
- [ ] 4 maritime legal templates created (casualty analysis, statistical context, expert
  witness report, liability framing)
- [ ] Maritime legal decision workflow (7-step) documented with sample I/O
- [ ] MAIB/NTSB statistical context prompt validated against `worldenergydata` loaders
- [ ] Demo script (15-20 min) includes maritime legal showcase (casualty analysis moment)
- [ ] Legal scan passes

## Agentic AI Horizon

Complex: diffraction workflow accuracy and FAD chart interpretation require engineering
validation. Claude orchestrates; Codex drafts files; use `digitalmodel.diffraction` module
outputs (WRK-590/591) as reference examples for the AQWA template formats.
