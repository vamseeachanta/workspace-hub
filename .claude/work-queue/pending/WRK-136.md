# Scrape Additional Operator Fleets — Transocean, Borr, Valaris Sub-Pages

## What
Extend the vessel_fleet scrape pipeline to parse individual rig detail pages for Transocean (26 rigs), Borr (31 rigs), and Valaris sub-fleet pages. Noble (31) and Seadrill (17) scrape parsers already exist from WRK-104.

## Why
WRK-104 Step 0 validated that these operators have public fleet pages with detailed rig data. Transocean and Borr have HTML tables; Valaris has 4 sub-fleet pages (jackups, semis, drillships, managed platforms). Scraping these adds ~57+ additional enriched rig records with hull dimensions, water depth, and design class — important for RAO/diffraction mapping (WRK-102, WRK-115).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Transocean fleet page parser: 26 rigs with rig name, type, water depth from HTML table
- [ ] Borr fleet page parser: 31 rigs with rig name, design, builder, year built, water depth
- [ ] Valaris sub-page scrape: drill into 4 sub-fleet pages to extract individual rig data
- [ ] Scrape JSON stored in `data/modules/vessel_fleet/raw/contractor_scrape/`
- [ ] Parsers in `src/worldenergydata/vessel_fleet/parsers/` (one per operator)
- [ ] Hull dimensions (LOA, beam, draft) captured where available on fleet pages
- [ ] Unit tests with fixture HTML data

## Reference
- Validation report: `docs/data/rig-fleet-website-validation.md`
- Puppeteer scraper: `scripts/vessel_fleet/scrape_contractor_fleets.js`
- Existing Noble/Seadrill parsers as pattern: `vessel_fleet/parsers/scrape_json.py`
