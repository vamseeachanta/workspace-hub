# Document client/portfolio repos in ecosystem docs

## What
Update `workspace-structure.md` and `roadmap-2026-h1.md` to formally document
the client/portfolio repo category: `frontierdeepwater`, `doris`, `saipem`,
`acma-projects`. These follow client project conventions (project IDs, domain folders)
and require no structural changes — only clear documentation of their role and indexing strategy.

## Why
Tier-1 consistency review (2026-02-23): these repos have empty `src/` + vestigial
Python scaffolding, which looks inconsistent. Documenting them as "project management repos"
(not Python libraries) prevents future confusion and clarifies the indexing requirement.

## Scope
- Update `workspace-structure.md`: add "Project/Client Repos" category with explanation
  - These follow client conventions, not workspace-hub Python conventions
  - Navigation/indexing is the key interface (not API surface)
  - Cross-reference document intelligence parallel story
- Add note to document intelligence work if applicable (`docs/` or specs)
- No structural changes to the repos themselves

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `workspace-structure.md` has a "Project/Client Repos" section
- [ ] Section explains why these repos don't follow src/ convention
- [ ] Section references document intelligence / indexing story as parallel track
- [ ] Roadmap entry for these repos updated if needed

## Notes
- `acma-projects` uses embedded `src/external/assetutilities/` copy — flag in docs as
  "needs migration to git dependency" (separate WRK item if pursued)
- Document intelligence indexing story is a parallel track — just cross-reference here
