# governance(review): strengthen claim gate metadata

## Problem

The claim gate is supposed to record agent fit and quota readiness, yet orchestrator evidence still occasionally omits fresh quota/session metadata. Without automated claim integrity, reruns or new orchestrators may claim execution with stale quota snapshots or incomplete owner assignments.

## What

Improve the claim gate by ensuring `claim-evidence.yaml` always captures the latest session owner, quota snapshot result, blocking status, and agent fit rationale. Tie the claim step to a short automated checklist that re-validates quota freshness before allowing the orchestrator to proceed to execute, and have orchestrator summaries mention any rerun triggered by a quota/owner change.

## Plan

- Phase 1 — Metadata schema: extend the claim evidence template to require `session_owner`, `agent_fit`, `quota_snapshot` (with timestamp), and blocking state.
- Phase 2 — Validator hook: create a script (or extend existing validator) that fails the claim gate when `quota_snapshot.status` is not `available` or `session_owner` is missing.
- Phase 3 — Orchestrator runbook: update orchestrator instructions so they refresh the claim evidence right before execution, rerunning the quota check if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Claim evidence assets include session owner, agent fit rationale, current quota snapshot, and blocking flag.
- [ ] Validator rejects claims missing the new metadata.
- [ ] Orchestrator run instructions refresh quota before execution and log the result in the claim asset.
- [ ] The orchestrator comparison displays the improved claim metadata link and any rerun triggers caused by quota shifts.

## Outcome

Claim evidence will become a repeatable, unbiased gate that can be inspected across Claude/Codex/Gemini to ensure run-time readiness before execution begins.
