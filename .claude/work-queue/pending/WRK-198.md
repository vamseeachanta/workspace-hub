# HSE Risk Index Interactive Dashboard

## What
Deploy the HSE risk index (WRK-014, delivered) as an interactive web demonstration on aceengineer-website. Allow users to explore risk scores by activity category, field, water depth, and time period.

## Why
- WRK-014 built the scoring module — this makes it visible to prospects
- GTM strategy needs "try before you buy" touchpoints
- Demonstrates AI-augmented safety analytics capability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Interactive HTML page with pre-computed risk data (no backend required)
- [x] Filters: activity category, water depth band, time period
- [x] Risk score heatmap or ranked table
- [x] Time-trend chart (annual rolling average)
- [x] Methodology explainer section
- [x] Linked from energy.html services section

## Implementation Notes (2026-02-24)

- `demos/hse-risk-dashboard.html` — self-contained interactive dashboard with Plotly charts
- `demos/hse-risk-dashboard-data.js` — pre-computed risk data module (20 activity rows, 15-year trend)
- `tests/js/hse-risk-dashboard.test.js` — 33 Jest unit tests (all passing)
- `package.json` — added hse-dashboard jest project entry
- `energy.html` — linked from new "HSE Risk Intelligence" section
- Legal scan: PASS (aceengineer-website)
- Cross-review: external API unavailable in local environment (Codex gpt-4.1 not supported); logic verified via Node unit tests

## Agentic AI Horizon

- HSE risk index interactive dashboard on the aceengineer website is a differentiated professional tool that demonstrates engineering rigour — direct marketing and lead generation value.
- Interactive dashboards backed by data are compelling client-facing assets; improved agents will help generate content but the dashboard infrastructure must exist first.
- **Disposition: invest now** — a professional-grade HSE risk tool on the website directly differentiates A&CE in the market; build the dashboard now as a high-impact marketing asset.
