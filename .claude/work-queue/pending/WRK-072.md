# Technical Safety Analysis Module for WorldEnergyData

## What
Port and integrate the technical safety analysis theory, code, and methodologies from the ENIGMA project (`client_projects/energy_firm_sd_support/xom/000 ENIGMA/`) into the `worldenergydata` repository as a structured safety analysis module.

## Why
The ENIGMA project contains mature safety analysis code (NLP classification, incident analysis, hypothesis testing, ML models for safety observations) that should be generalized and integrated into worldenergydata as a reusable technical safety analysis capability.

## Source Material (ENIGMA)
- **NLP pipeline**: TF-IDF, BERT, Doc2Vec, LSTM, Word2Vec models for safety observation card classification
- **Incident analysis**: `incident_analysis.py`, `incident_analysis_2022.py` — incident trend analysis
- **Maintenance analysis**: `maintenance_analysis.py` — maintenance-related safety patterns
- **NPT analysis**: Non-productive time correlation with safety incidents
- **Hypothesis testing**: `sshe_NLP/hypothesis_testing/` — statistical safety hypothesis tests
- **Preprocessing**: 16+ preprocessing scripts for safety text data
- **Safety rubrics**: PlantUML diagrams for safety metric frameworks (`Enigma_safety_rubric_event.puml`, grouped metrics, incident metrics)
- **PTW analysis**: Permit-to-work safety analysis

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit ENIGMA codebase and document reusable components vs client-specific code
- [ ] Design module structure within worldenergydata (`src/worldenergydata/safety/` or `modules/safety/`)
- [ ] Port generalizable NLP safety classification pipeline (TF-IDF + BERT at minimum)
- [ ] Port incident analysis and trend detection logic
- [ ] Port hypothesis testing framework for safety metrics
- [ ] Create safety data schemas (incident records, observation cards, PTW records)
- [ ] Add tests following TDD (80%+ coverage on new module)
- [ ] Add documentation in `docs/hse/` for the safety analysis module
- [ ] Ensure no client-specific data or credentials are transferred
