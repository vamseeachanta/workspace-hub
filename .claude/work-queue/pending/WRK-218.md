# Well Bore Design Analysis — Slim Hole vs. Standard Hole

## Context

A LinkedIn post and newsletter article by Radmir Ganiev, PhD ("Drilling Advisor's Logbook",
Feb 19, 2026) lays out the engineering trade-off framework for slim-hole vs. standard-hole
well design. The core finding: **slim-hole drilling is a complete system redesign, not a
diameter reduction** — it cascades through casing programs, BHA design, hydraulics, and
logistics. This is particularly relevant for deepwater and ERD (extended reach drilling)
applications where narrow pressure windows and challenging geometries make well bore sizing
a high-stakes engineering decision.

Software referenced in industry practice: **HYDPRO** (Pegasus Vertex — A LINQX Company),
**WELLPLAN** (Halliburton).

## What

Build a well bore design analysis module covering the hydraulic and mechanical trade-offs
between slim-hole and standard-hole well design:

### Part 1 — Well Bore Design Data Model (worldenergydata)

Structured schema for well bore configuration parameters:

```python
class WellBoreDesign:
    bore_type: str                    # "slim_hole", "standard", "big_hole"
    nominal_diameter_in: float        # e.g., 6.0 (slim), 8.5 (standard), 12.25 (big)
    casing_od_in: float               # casing OD in inches
    casing_grade: str                 # e.g., "P110", "Q125"
    casing_weight_ppf: float          # weight per foot
    mud_weight_ppg: float             # drilling fluid density
    flow_rate_gpm: float              # circulation rate
    rop_ft_hr: float | None           # rate of penetration
    water_depth_ft: float | None      # for offshore
    measured_depth_ft: float          # total measured depth
    well_type: str                    # "vertical", "directional", "ERD", "HPHT"

class EcdProfile:
    bore_id: str
    depth_ft: list[float]
    ecd_ppg: list[float]              # Equivalent Circulating Density profile
    annular_pressure_loss_psi: float  # total annular pressure loss
    surface_backpressure_psi: float   # if MPD applied
    rotation_rpm: float               # effect of rotation on ECD
    flow_rate_gpm: float              # flow rate at which ECD computed
```

### Part 2 — Hydraulic Analysis Engine (digitalmodel)

Core engineering calculations for well bore hydraulic performance:

1. **ECD calculator** — Equivalent Circulating Density as a function of:
   - Bore diameter (slim vs. standard)
   - Mud weight, viscosity, flow rate, rotation
   - Annular geometry (drill pipe OD vs. bore ID)
   - For slim holes: ECD sensitivity is heightened — small changes in flow rate or rotation
     have proportionally larger effects on annular pressure

2. **Annular pressure loss model** — Bingham plastic or power law rheology model for
   annular pressure loss in the drill string / bore annulus

3. **Surge/swab pressure calculator** — Pressure transients during tripping operations,
   particularly critical in slim holes with narrow clearances

4. **Hole cleaning model** — Cuttings transport efficiency as a function of:
   - Annular velocity (limited by bore cross-section in slim holes)
   - Cutting size, density, shape
   - Inclination (ERD penalty)

### Part 3 — Decision Framework (digitalmodel)

Engineering-economic decision model for bore size selection:

1. **Pressure window compatibility check**:
   - Pore pressure gradient vs. fracture gradient (narrow window → slim preferred for ECD headroom)
   - MPD availability as an alternative to slim-hole for narrow-margin wells (link to WRK-168)

2. **Application matrix** — when slim-hole is preferred vs. standard:

   | Condition | Slim Preferred | Standard Preferred |
   |-----------|---------------|-------------------|
   | Narrow pore/fracture window | ✓ (lower ECD) | |
   | HPHT | | ✓ (mechanical margins) |
   | High-rate producer | | ✓ (production tubing size) |
   | Deepwater ERD | ✓ (hydraulic efficiency) | |
   | High formation damage risk | ✓ (lower invasion) | |
   | Well control (HPHT/sour) | | ✓ (larger BOP/kill margins) |

3. **Capital efficiency vs. operational flexibility trade-off**:
   - Slim hole: lower casing CAPEX, reduced mud volume, smaller rig requirement
   - Standard hole: larger completion string options, higher production rates, more workover options

4. **Software integration targets** — interface for HYDPRO/WELLPLAN output import:
   - Parse HYDPRO hydraulics output (annular pressure loss, ECD reports)
   - Parse WELLPLAN torque-and-drag and hydraulics output
   - Validate A&CE calculations against industry software benchmarks

### Part 4 — Blog/Content Asset (aceengineer-website)

See WRK-080 for the blog post candidate. This Part 4 is the data visualization companion
to that post:

- ECD vs. bore diameter comparison chart (slim vs. standard at same depth/mud weight)
- Pressure window compatibility visualization (pore pressure / fracture gradient / ECD)
- Annular velocity vs. inclination for hole cleaning comparison

## Why

- **Engineering capability gap**: A&CE has riser hydraulics (WRK-046) and MPD pressure
  management (WRK-168) but no dedicated well bore design sizing module. Hydraulic analysis
  for well design (ECD, annular pressure) is a foundational drilling engineering service.
- **GTM positioning**: Well bore design trade-offs are a recurring consulting deliverable
  for operators selecting between slim/standard configurations on deepwater and ERD projects.
- **Connection to risk framework**: WRK-163's well planning risk framework needs a technical
  basis for bore-size-related risks (e.g., "slim hole chosen but narrow pressure window
  requires ECD management → MPD recommended → rig capability check").
- **Data link**: worldenergydata BSEE well data includes bore diameters for existing wells
  — can benchmark proposed designs against real field data.

## Key Technical References

- Slim-hole: hydraulic modeling mandatory (not optional)
- ECD in slim holes has heightened sensitivity to flow rate and rotation
- Hole cleaning: reduced annular velocity is the primary mechanical constraint in slim holes
- Surge/swab: narrow clearances amplify pressure transients during tripping
- Standard holes retain advantage for HPHT and high-rate applications
- MPD as an alternative to slim-hole for narrow-margin deepwater wells (WRK-168)
