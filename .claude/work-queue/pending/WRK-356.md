# CP module — sacrificial anode design full calculations per DNV-RP-B401

## What

Extend the existing CP module (WRK-279 done) to add full sacrificial anode design calculations
per DNV-RP-B401. Net anode mass, current capacity, anode number, distribution, and anode
dimensions. Currently only CP current demand is implemented.

## Why

The CP module from WRK-279 calculates current demand but stops short of full anode design.
Completing the DNV-RP-B401 workflow end-to-end — from current demand through anode sizing
and distribution — makes the module a complete cathodic protection design tool for offshore
structures and pipelines.

## Standards

- DNV-RP-B401

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Anode material properties (Al, Zn alloys) with electrochemical capacity and driving voltage
- [ ] Net anode mass calculation from current demand and design life
- [ ] Anode number and distribution (initial and final current demand)
- [ ] Anode resistance calculation (McCoy, Dwight formulas for various geometries)
- [ ] Anode dimension sizing (bracelet, standoff, flush-mounted)
- [ ] Existing WRK-279 current demand tests still pass (no regression)
- [ ] New pytest coverage for anode design calculations with hand-calc verification
