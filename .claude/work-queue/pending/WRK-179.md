# WRK-179: Start Hook — Agent Capacity Pre-flight

## What
Before starting work, check all three providers (Claude/Codex/Gemini) quota status from cached data. If primary provider is >90% weekly utilization, suggest task routing to alternative provider. Prevents mid-session quota exhaustion.

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Implement `hooks/readiness/agent-capacity.sh` — read `agent-quota-latest.json`
- [ ] Phase 2: Display provider capacity summary at session start
- [ ] Phase 3: Suggest routing when primary is >90% — reference `assign-providers.sh` for alternatives
