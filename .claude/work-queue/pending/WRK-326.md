# Unified CLI — single ace command routing to all repo tools

## What

Create a unified `ace` CLI entry point at the workspace-hub level that routes to tools in all
repos. Example: `ace dm fatigue`, `ace wed bsee`, `ace ah portfolio`. Thin wrapper using
subprocess routing based on subcommand prefix. Add shell completion.

## Why

Each repo currently has its own CLI entry point, requiring the user to know which repo
provides which tool. A unified `ace` command simplifies discoverability and provides a single
interface to the entire workspace-hub toolset. Shell completion makes it practical for daily
use.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `ace` CLI entry point installed at workspace-hub level (pyproject.toml console_scripts)
- [ ] Subcommand routing: prefix maps to repo (dm=digitalmodel, wed=worldenergydata,
      ah=assethold, etc.)
- [ ] Subprocess delegation: `ace dm fatigue ...` invokes digitalmodel's fatigue CLI
- [ ] `ace --list` shows all available subcommands across all repos
- [ ] Bash/Zsh completion script generation
- [ ] Graceful error handling: unknown subcommand, repo not installed, missing dependencies
- [ ] Pytest coverage for routing logic and error paths
