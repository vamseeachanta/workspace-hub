# API RP 1111 deepwater pipeline design checks — collapse and propagating buckle

## What

Implement API RP 1111 Section 4 checks for deepwater pipelines: external pressure collapse,
propagating buckle design (buckle arrestors), combined loading. Complement DNV-ST-F101 checks
for Gulf of Mexico projects.

## Why

API RP 1111 is the US standard for deepwater pipeline design, widely used in Gulf of Mexico
projects. While DNV-ST-F101 is the international standard, many GOM operators require API RP
1111 compliance. Having both codes available in doris enables dual-code verification — a
common project requirement.

## Standards

- API RP 1111

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] External pressure collapse check per API RP 1111 Section 4.3
- [ ] Propagating buckle initiation pressure per Section 4.3.2
- [ ] Buckle arrestor design (crossover pressure calculation)
- [ ] Combined loading: internal/external pressure + bending per Section 4.4
- [ ] Wall thickness sizing: given water depth and pressure, output minimum WT
- [ ] ASCII-first config input consistent with WRK-330 format
- [ ] Pytest coverage with known hand-calc verification points
