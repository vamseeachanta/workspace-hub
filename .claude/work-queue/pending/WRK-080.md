# Write 4 energy data blog posts for SEO

## What
Write 4 technical blog posts targeting energy data SEO keywords. The website has 9 blog posts — all engineering/fatigue focused. Zero posts target energy data, field economics, or marine safety keywords.

## Why
Blog posts drive organic search traffic. Energy data keywords (BSEE production data, NPV deepwater analysis, marine safety databases) have no content on the site, meaning zero organic discovery for the new energy data service line.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Blog post 1: "How to Access Gulf of Mexico Production Data Programmatically"
- [ ] Blog post 2: "NPV Analysis for Deepwater Field Development with Python"
- [ ] Blog post 3: "Marine Safety Incident Analysis: Correlating Global Databases"
- [ ] Blog post 4: "Energy Data Automation: From Manual Research to Automated Pipelines"
- [ ] Each post 2,500-3,500 words (matching existing post length)
- [ ] Proper meta tags, JSON-LD BlogPosting schema
- [ ] Internal links to energy.html and contact.html
- [ ] Technical depth showing real expertise (not generic content)

## Plan

### Existing Blog Post Pattern (Template to Follow)

Each blog post follows this established structure discovered in the repo:

**Source template**: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/aceengineer-website/src/blog/machine-learning-fatigue-prediction.html`

1. **Front matter**: `---\nrootPath: "../"\n
---`
2. **HTML head**: meta description, keywords, OG tags, Twitter cards, JSON-LD `BlogPosting` schema, BreadcrumbList schema
3. **Inline CSS**: article-content, article-header, article-meta, highlight-box, comparison-table, code-example, cta-section, key-insight, warning-box
4. **Body structure**: `<include src="partials/nav.html">`, container > article > header > sections > CTA > `<include src="partials/footer.html">`
5. **Article meta line**: Author (Vamsee Achanta) | Published date | Reading Time | Category
6. **Abstract**: highlight-box with bold "Abstract:" prefix
7. **Code examples**: div.code-example with monospace font, dark background (#2d2d2d)
8. **CTA section**: orange background (#E95420), links to contact.html and case-studies

**Blog index listing pattern**: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/aceengineer-website/src/blog/index.html`
- Each post listed as `div.blog-post` with h3 link, div.blog-meta, p.blog-excerpt (2 paragraphs), div.read-more with btn-primary

**Existing posts** (all engineering/fatigue focused -- confirming the gap):
- `machine-learning-fatigue-prediction.html`
- `ai-native-structural-analysis.html`
- `open-source-engineering-tools.html`
- `python-engineering-automation.html`
- `offshore-engineering-standards.html`
- `digital-twins-offshore-assets.html`
- `risk-based-inspection-planning.html`
- `cfd-offshore-engineering.html`

### Additional Blog Post Candidates

**Blog Post 5 (candidate): "Offshore SURF Market 2027-2028: Why Capacity Is the Real Risk, Not Demand"**

- **Source**: LinkedIn post by Erik De Haas (2026-02-19)
  - URL: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erik-de-haas_the-narrative-says-offshore-is-cooling-but-share-7428438469489893376-p_-M
- **Key insight**: Execution windows for major subsea projects are converging around Summer 2027 and 2028
  (Chevron Gorgon Stage 3, Saipem/TechnipFMC campaigns, new cable-lay vessels from Ulstein/Prysmian).
  The market risk is capacity shortage, not demand shortage.
- **Quotable hook**: "Offshore isn't cooling, it's queuing."
- **SEO keywords**: subsea installation market, SURF vessel capacity, offshore contractor outlook,
  Subsea7 Saipem TechnipFMC 2027, offshore installation windows
- **Data points to use**:
  - Seven Arctic positioning for Gorgon Stage 3 (2028 execution)
  - Workforce attrition during 2026 lull → ~30% rate increases by 2028 (Vince Kelly comment)
  - Contractors diverging: some laying off, others aggressively hiring (market fragmentation)
  - M&A consolidation securing dedicated vessel capacity for 2027-2028
- **Content angle**: Engineering consultancy perspective — how to de-risk project schedules when
  installation windows are over-subscribed; when to lock in spread availability vs. when to wait
- **Internal links**: engineering.html (offshore analysis services), contact.html

**Blog Post 6 (candidate): "Slim Hole vs. Standard Hole: Engineering Trade-Offs That Define Well Economics"**

- **Source**: Radmir Ganiev, PhD — "Drilling Advisor's Logbook" newsletter (Feb 19, 2026)
  - URL: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/radmirganiev_bighole-slimhole-welldesign-ugcPost-7430142115973779456-4_w-/
- **Key insight**: Slim-hole drilling is a complete system redesign, not a diameter reduction —
  it cascades through casing programs, BHA design, hydraulics, and logistics. ECD becomes
  hypersensitive to flow rate and rotation; hole cleaning margins shrink.
- **SEO keywords**: slim hole drilling, well bore design, ECD management, HYDPRO WELLPLAN,
  offshore well economics, deepwater ERD drilling
- **Data points to use**:
  - ECD sensitivity comparison: slim vs. standard at same depth/mud weight (WRK-218 module)
  - Application matrix: when slim beats standard (narrow pressure window, ERD, capital efficiency)
  - BSEE well data: bore diameter distribution across GoM deepwater wells
  - Software in use: HYDPRO (Pegasus Vertex), WELLPLAN (Halliburton) — position A&CE analysis
    as validation layer
- **Content angle**: Practitioner framing — "Why your hydraulics model becomes non-optional
  in slim-hole design, and what the trade-off really costs operationally." Decision framework
  with engineering depth, not vendor marketing.
- **Internal links**: engineering.html (drilling analysis services), contact.html
- **Related WRK**: WRK-218 (well bore design analysis module)

**Blog Post 7 (candidate): "Batch Drilling: How Deepwater Operators Amortize Day Rates Across Campaigns"**

- **Source**: Radmir Ganiev, PhD — "Drilling Advisor's Logbook" newsletter (Feb 10, 2026)
  - URL: https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/drilling-advisor%E2%80%99s-logbook-7427090343919194112/
- **Key insight**: Batch drilling reduces per-well cost through mobilization amortization,
  learning curve gains, and BHA standardization — but sequence matters (geography, formation
  similarity, NPV ordering). Most operators under-optimize their batch sequences.
- **SEO keywords**: batch drilling deepwater, offshore drilling campaign optimization,
  rig day rate economics, deepwater well sequencing, drilling cost reduction
- **Data points to use**:
  - BSEE historical batch campaign detection: same rig, same field, sequential wells
  - Learning curve factor from real GoM campaigns (10-15% per doubling)
  - NPV comparison: batch vs. standalone at $400-600K/day drillship rates
- **Content angle**: Data-backed A&CE analysis of GoM batch campaigns using BSEE public data —
  demonstrates both data access and economic modeling capability.
- **Internal links**: energy.html (energy data services), contact.html
- **Related WRK**: WRK-219 (batch drilling economics module)
