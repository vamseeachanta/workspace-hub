# Write 4 energy data blog posts for SEO

## What
Write 4 technical blog posts targeting energy data SEO keywords. The website has 9 blog posts — all engineering/fatigue focused. Zero posts target energy data, field economics, or marine safety keywords.

## Why
Blog posts drive organic search traffic. Energy data keywords (BSEE production data, NPV deepwater analysis, marine safety databases) have no content on the site, meaning zero organic discovery for the new energy data service line.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Blog post 1: "How to Access Gulf of Mexico Production Data Programmatically"
- [ ] Blog post 2: "NPV Analysis for Deepwater Field Development with Python"
- [ ] Blog post 3: "Marine Safety Incident Analysis: Correlating Global Databases"
- [ ] Blog post 4: "Energy Data Automation: From Manual Research to Automated Pipelines"
- [ ] Each post 2,500-3,500 words (matching existing post length)
- [ ] Proper meta tags, JSON-LD BlogPosting schema
- [ ] Internal links to energy.html and contact.html
- [ ] Technical depth showing real expertise (not generic content)
