# Create public sample data access page on website

## What
Create a static page on the website with downloadable sample datasets and embedded dashboard screenshots. Gives prospects a tangible way to evaluate data quality and dashboard capabilities without requiring a sales call.

## Why
No demo or trial access exists. Prospects see marketing claims but cannot validate them. A sample data page reduces sales friction and builds trust.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Static HTML page at demos/ or samples/ path
- [ ] 2-3 downloadable sample datasets (CSV/Excel) from BSEE public data
- [ ] Embedded screenshots of production dashboards
- [ ] Brief descriptions of what each dataset contains
- [ ] Links to contact.html for full access
- [ ] Matches site design (Bootstrap + marketing.css)
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data

## Plan

### Existing Site Patterns to Follow

**Page structure pattern**: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/aceengineer-website/src/energy.html`
- Standard head with meta, OG, JSON-LD
- `<include src="partials/nav.html">`
- Bootstrap container with sections
- `<include src="partials/footer.html">`
- Uses `styles.min.css` via head-common partial

**Data assets directory**: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/aceengineer-website/assets/data/` (exists, currently holds statistics.json)

**Calculator page pattern** (good reference for interactive/download pages):
- `src/calculators/index.html` -- grid of cards with descriptions and action buttons

### Phase 1: Prepare Sample Datasets (2 hours)

**Prerequisite**: WRK-075 (data packaging) must be done first -- this item is blocked.

Once WRK-075 is complete, prepare 2-3 small CSV samples from BSEE public data:

1. **Sample 1: GoM Production Summary** (small, ~50 rows)
   - Fields: field_name, year, oil_bbl, gas_mcf, water_bbl, water_depth_ft
   - Source: worldenergydata BSEE production_raw aggregated by field
   - Target: `aceengineer-website/assets/data/samples/gom-production-summary.csv`

2. **Sample 2: Deepwater Well Completions** (small, ~30 rows)
   - Fields: api_well_number, field_name, water_depth_ft, completion_date, well_type, status
   - Source: worldenergydata BSEE completions data
   - Target: `aceengineer-website/assets/data/samples/deepwater-well-completions.csv`

3. **Sample 3: Rig Fleet Summary** (small, ~16 rows)
   - Fields: rig_name, rig_type, water_depth_rating, year_built, status
   - Source: worldenergydata rig_fleet data (already 16 rigs available)
   - Target: `aceengineer-website/assets/data/samples/rig-fleet-summary.csv`

All samples must use only BSEE public data -- no proprietary or client data.

### Phase 2: Create Sample Data Page (3 hours)

1. **Create file**: `src/samples/index.html`
   - Front matter: `rootPath: "../"`

2. **HTML head**:
   - Meta description: "Download free sample energy datasets from Gulf of Mexico BSEE public data"
   - Keywords: BSEE data download, Gulf of Mexico production data, offshore well data, energy sample datasets
   - JSON-LD `DataCatalog` schema:
     ```json
     {
       "@type": "DataCatalog",
       "name": "A&CE Energy Data Samples",
       "dataset": [
         {"@type": "Dataset", "name": "GoM Production Summary", "distribution": {"@type": "DataDownload", "encodingFormat": "text/csv"}}
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **Page layout** (Bootstrap grid):
   - **Hero section**: "Sample Energy Datasets" heading, brief description
   - **Dataset cards** (row of col-md-4 cards, each containing):
     - Dataset title
     - Brief description (2-3 sentences)
     - Data preview: small HTML table showing first 5 rows
     - File size and row count
     - "Download CSV" button (`<a href="..." download>`)
   - **Dashboard screenshots section**:
     - 2-3 embedded PNG screenshots of production dashboards
     - Brief caption describing what each dashboard shows
     - Target: `assets/img/samples/` directory for screenshots
   - **CTA section**:
     - "Want Full Access?" heading
     - Description of full dataset scope (356 datasets, 6.8GB per data catalog)
     - Link to `contact.html?vertical=energy-data`

4. **CSS**: Use existing Bootstrap card patterns + marketing.css styles
   - Sample table: `table.table.table-striped` (Bootstrap built-in)
   - Download button: `btn btn-primary` with download icon

### Phase 3: Dashboard Screenshots (1 hour)

1. Create placeholder screenshots or generate from existing worldenergydata visualization outputs
2. Save to: `assets/img/samples/`
   - `production-dashboard.png` -- field production over time
   - `rig-fleet-map.png` -- geographic distribution of rigs
   - `decline-curve-analysis.png` -- production decline curve example
3. Optimize images: compress to < 200KB each for fast page load

### Phase 4: Navigation and Cross-Links (1 hour)

1. **Add to nav**: Consider adding "Samples" or "Data" link to nav if appropriate, or link from energy.html
   - File: `src/partials/nav.html` -- currently has Home, About, Services, Case Studies, Blog, Contact
   - Alternative: add link from energy.html page rather than top nav (less intrusive)
2. **Update energy.html**: Add section linking to sample data page
   - File: `src/energy.html`
3. **Update sitemap.xml**: Add `samples/index.html`
4. **Rebuild**: `node build.js`

### File Paths Summary

New files:
- `aceengineer-website/src/samples/index.html`
- `aceengineer-website/assets/data/samples/gom-production-summary.csv`
- `aceengineer-website/assets/data/samples/deepwater-well-completions.csv`
- `aceengineer-website/assets/data/samples/rig-fleet-summary.csv`
- `aceengineer-website/assets/img/samples/` (2-3 PNG screenshots)

Files to modify:
- `aceengineer-website/src/energy.html` (add link to samples page)
- `aceengineer-website/sitemap.xml` (add URL)

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

- **BLOCKED BY WRK-075**: Data packaging must be complete before sample datasets can be prepared
- Sample data must come exclusively from BSEE public data (legal compliance per `.claude/rules/legal-compliance.md`)
- No server-side code needed -- static HTML + CSV files served by GitHub Pages
- Screenshots need to be generated or captured from existing visualization tools

### Test Strategy

- Verify all CSV download links work (href points to correct path)
- Validate CSV files open correctly in Excel/Google Sheets
- Check JSON-LD DataCatalog schema with Google Rich Results Test
- Test responsive layout on mobile
- Verify all internal links (energy.html, contact.html) resolve correctly

### Review Notes

|----------|---------|
| Claude Opus 4.6 | APPROVE |
| Gemini CLI | APPROVE |
| Codex CLI | NO_OUTPUT |

**Feedback incorporated**:
- Blocking dependency on WRK-075 correctly tracked
- Sample dataset sizes (50, 30, 16 rows) appropriately small
- JSON-LD DataCatalog schema is a good SEO touch

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Public sample data access page on the website supports lead generation and data transparency — moderate marketing value.
- Web page generation will be easier with improved agents in 3–4 months; the data behind it already exists.
- **Disposition: park 2-3 months** — a low-urgency website task; execute alongside WRK-146 website overhaul when that is in progress.
