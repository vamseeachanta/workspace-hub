# Create public sample data access page on website

## What
Create a static page on the website with downloadable sample datasets and embedded dashboard screenshots. Gives prospects a tangible way to evaluate data quality and dashboard capabilities without requiring a sales call.

## Why
No demo or trial access exists. Prospects see marketing claims but cannot validate them. A sample data page reduces sales friction and builds trust.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Static HTML page at demos/ or samples/ path
- [ ] 2-3 downloadable sample datasets (CSV/Excel) from BSEE public data
- [ ] Embedded screenshots of production dashboards
- [ ] Brief descriptions of what each dataset contains
- [ ] Links to contact.html for full access
- [ ] Matches site design (Bootstrap + marketing.css)
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data
