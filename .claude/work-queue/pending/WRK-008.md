# Upload photos from Sabitha phone, Vamsee phone, and Doris computer to achantas-media

## What
Collect photos from three source devices (Sabitha's phone, Vamsee's phone, and Doris's computer) and upload them to the achantas-media repository. Photos should be organized by date and source during the process.

## Why
Centralize family photo collection in achantas-media for unified access, backup, and sharing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Photos collected from Sabitha's phone
- [ ] Photos collected from Vamsee's phone
- [ ] Photos collected from Doris's computer
- [ ] Photos organized by date and source
- [ ] All photos uploaded to achantas-media

## Plan

- **Step 1**: Collect photos from each device (AirDrop/USB for phones, network share for computer)
- **Step 2**: Organize by EXIF date and source device into `YYYY/MM/` directory structure. For photos without EXIF date metadata, fall back to (a) filename date pattern parsing (e.g., `IMG_20250115_*`), then (b) file modification timestamp, then (c) place in `YYYY/MM/unsorted/` using the file's filesystem date. Store photos in original format (HEIC, JPEG, PNG) without conversion; deduplication operates on original files only
- **Step 3**: Deduplicate using hash comparison (SHA-256)
- **Step 3.5**: Verify achantas-media repo supports large binary storage (Git LFS or similar). If total photo collection exceeds 1GB, configure LFS tracking for image extensions before committing
- **Step 4**: Upload organized collection to achantas-media repo
- **Step 5**: Verify upload by comparing: (a) total source count across all devices, (b) duplicates removed count, (c) final destination count. Assert that source_total - duplicates_removed = destination_count

### Review Notes

- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR
- **Actions taken**:
  - Added EXIF fallback strategy to Step 2: filename pattern parsing, then file modification timestamp, then unsorted directory
  - Added format handling note to Step 2: store in original format (HEIC/JPEG/PNG), no conversion
  - Added Step 3.5 for Git LFS verification when collection exceeds 1GB
  - Rewrote Step 5 with deduplication-aware verification formula (source_total - duplicates_removed = destination_count)
