# WRK-182: Predictive Session Planning

## What
Based on WRK item complexity, historical session durations, and available quota, predict optimal session plan: which phases to tackle, which agents to use, estimated completion probability. Surface as "Today's recommended plan" at session start.

## SME Discussion Required
- **AI Operations**: What historical data is needed to build reliable predictions?
- **All**: How to handle uncertainty — confidence intervals or binary go/no-go?
- **Engineering**: Should engineering task criticality influence planning priority?

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Collect session duration + task complexity data from archived sessions
- [x] Phase 2: Build simple heuristic model (complexity * agent_speed * quota_remaining)
- [x] Phase 3: Implement `hooks/readiness/session-planner.sh` — display recommended plan
- [ ] Phase 4: Iterate model with feedback from actual session outcomes

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Predictive session planning (recommending which phases to tackle based on complexity and quota) is a session efficiency tool with direct agentic value.
- Session planning AI will improve substantially; models with better planning and quota-awareness will handle this natively in 3–4 months.
- **Disposition: park 3 months** — predictive session planning is approaching a platform-level capability; revisit May 2026 when session-awareness in Claude Code has matured.
