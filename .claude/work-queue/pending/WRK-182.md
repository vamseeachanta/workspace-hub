# WRK-182: Predictive Session Planning

## What
Based on WRK item complexity, historical session durations, and available quota, predict optimal session plan: which phases to tackle, which agents to use, estimated completion probability. Surface as "Today's recommended plan" at session start.

## SME Discussion Required
- **AI Operations**: What historical data is needed to build reliable predictions?
- **All**: How to handle uncertainty — confidence intervals or binary go/no-go?
- **Engineering**: Should engineering task criticality influence planning priority?

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Collect session duration + task complexity data from archived sessions
- [ ] Phase 2: Build simple heuristic model (complexity * agent_speed * quota_remaining)
- [ ] Phase 3: Implement `hooks/readiness/session-planner.sh` — display recommended plan
- [ ] Phase 4: Iterate model with feedback from actual session outcomes
