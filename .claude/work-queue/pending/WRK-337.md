# Vessel weather-window calculator — operability analysis from Hs Tp scatter

## What

Implement vessel weather-window calculator. Input: Hs/Tp scatter matrix (from NDBC/ERA5),
vessel motion RAOs, limiting sea states. Output: operability percentage per season/heading,
weather-window probability for specified operation duration.

## Why

Weather-window analysis is critical for offshore installation planning. It determines the
probability of having sufficient calm weather to complete marine operations. Automating this
calculation from scatter matrices and vessel RAOs enables rapid operability assessment for
different vessels, seasons, and locations without manual spreadsheet work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hs/Tp scatter matrix input (from WRK-316 NDBC data or manual CSV)
- [ ] Vessel motion RAO input (heave, roll, pitch as function of wave period/heading)
- [ ] Limiting sea state definition: maximum Hs, Tp range, motion limits
- [ ] Operability percentage: fraction of year/season where limits are satisfied
- [ ] Weather-window probability: probability of N consecutive hours below limits
- [ ] Seasonal breakdown: monthly or quarterly operability
- [ ] Directional analysis: operability per wave heading sector
- [ ] Pytest coverage with synthetic scatter data and known operability results
