# Metocean data extrapolation to target locations using GIS and nearest-source modeling

## What
Build a capability to extrapolate metocean data (wave and current) from the nearest available public or proprietary data source (e.g., NDBC buoys, hindcast databases) to a user-specified target location. The extrapolation must account for local terrain, bathymetry, and geographic features that influence wave propagation and current patterns. The workflow should leverage GIS tools and spatial APIs including Google Maps, Google Earth, and QGIS for spatial assessment and analysis.

## Why
Metocean data is rarely available at the exact location of interest. Engineering assessments for offshore and coastal projects require site-specific wave and current conditions. A systematic, terrain-aware extrapolation methodology bridges the gap between available data sources and project locations, improving the accuracy of design inputs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify and catalog available public metocean data sources (NDBC buoys, NOAA, Copernicus, hindcast models, etc.)
- [ ] Implement nearest-source identification: given a target lat/lon, find the closest data source(s)
- [ ] Integrate GIS tools for spatial analysis:
  - Google Maps / Google Earth API for location context and visualization
  - QGIS for bathymetry, terrain, and spatial analysis
- [ ] Develop extrapolation methodology for wave data (Hs, Tp, direction) accounting for:
  - Distance and direction from source to target
  - Bathymetry and seabed terrain between source and target
  - Sheltering effects (islands, headlands, structures)
  - Fetch length and wind exposure differences
- [ ] Develop extrapolation methodology for current data accounting for:
  - Tidal influences at target location
  - Local bathymetry-driven current patterns
  - Proximity to coastline, channels, or constrictions
- [ ] Produce output in standard metocean format (time series and/or statistical summaries)
- [ ] Validate approach against locations where both source and target data exist
- [ ] Document methodology, assumptions, limitations, and applicable range
- [ ] Provide visualization of source-to-target spatial relationship on map

*Source: metocean data extrapolation to different location based on available closest public or closed data source. this should utilize gis skill, software/apis such as google maps, google earth, qgis to assess and analyze details. eg: from data available from buoy closest to the location develop/extrapolate/model metocean (wave and current) data for the location taking into account the terrain*
