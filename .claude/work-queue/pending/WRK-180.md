# WRK-180: Stop Hook — Cross-Agent Learning Sync

## What
After multi-agent sessions (e.g., Codex did testing, Claude did architecture), consolidate learnings from all providers into a unified session summary. Currently each agent's insights are siloed in provider-specific session logs.

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Define unified learning format that works across Claude/Codex/Gemini outputs
- [ ] Phase 2: Implement `hooks/cross-agent-sync.sh` — detect multi-agent sessions, merge learnings
- [ ] Phase 3: Feed merged learnings into consume-signals.sh pipeline

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Cross-agent learning sync consolidates insights from multi-provider sessions into a unified summary — directly improves the quality of subsequent sessions.
- Session synthesis across agents will be significantly better with improved models in 3–4 months; the challenge is primarily one of context aggregation which is improving rapidly.
- **Disposition: park 3 months** — this is one of the items that will be substantially easier with better multi-agent coordination capabilities in May 2026; the current pattern (per-provider session logs) is sufficient for now.
