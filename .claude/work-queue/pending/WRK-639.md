# chore(skills): Audit and Resolve _diverged/ and incoming/ Skills

## Problem

The skills tree has two holding directories that are not valid promotion targets
(excluded from ecosystem-catalog.yaml by WRK-638):

- **`_diverged/`**: skills that diverged from canonical during submodule sync operations.
  Many are redundant copies of canonical skills under `engineering/`, `data/`, etc.
  They accumulate silently and confuse Phase 3c destination proposals.

- **`incoming/`**: skills from submodule contributions (digitalmodel, rock-oil-field)
  awaiting promotion to canonical paths. Currently: 4 skills (legal-sanity-scan,
  orcaflex-jumper-analysis, orcaflex-model-sanitization, orcaflex-spec-audit, +
  rock-oil-field bak skills).

## What

### Phase 1 — Audit `_diverged/`

For each `_diverged/<repo>/<skill>/SKILL.md`:
1. Find the canonical counterpart (if any) in the non-diverged skill tree
2. Diff the two SKILL.md files
3. Classify: **identical** (delete diverged) | **diverged-behind** (delete diverged) |
   **diverged-ahead** (merge improvements into canonical, then delete) |
   **orphan** (no canonical — evaluate: promote or archive)

Output: `specs/audit/diverged-skills-audit-<date>.md`

### Phase 2 — Resolve `incoming/`

For each `incoming/<repo>/<skill>/SKILL.md`:
1. Check if a canonical counterpart already exists
2. If yes: diff and merge improvements, then delete incoming
3. If no: move to canonical path (`engineering/marine-offshore/orcaflex-*` etc.)
4. Update any symlinks that pointed to incoming path

### Phase 3 — Cleanup

After audit: delete or archive resolved skills, update `skill-sync` logic to
prevent future `_diverged/` accumulation from sync operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `_diverged/` audit report generated with count per category
      (identical/behind/ahead/orphan)
- [ ] All `_diverged/` skills resolved (deleted or merged into canonical)
- [ ] All `incoming/` skills promoted to canonical paths or archived
- [ ] `specs/ecosystem-catalog.yaml` regenerated after cleanup (count increases)
- [ ] `skill-sync` SKILL.md updated to document how to prevent diverged accumulation
- [ ] Legal scan passes on all promoted skills

## Notes

- Phase 9 (Coverage Audit) in comprehensive-learning will prevent future
  accumulation — this WRK does the initial sweep
- `_diverged/` count is high (~100+ entries based on skill list) but most are
  likely identical copies — batch delete of identical ones is safe
- Do NOT delete `_archive/` — that is intentional historical storage
