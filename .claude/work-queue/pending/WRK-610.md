# Set up CAD-DEVELOPMENTS as AI-agent FEA pipeline repo in workspace-hub

## What

Restructure and integrate `CAD-DEVELOPMENTS` (a collaborator repo at `github.com/bakkiprasad5669/CAD-DEVELOPMENTS`) as a workspace-hub submodule with the right directory structure, README, and toolchain config to serve its mission: **AI-agent-driven FEA model development from scratch** (geometry → mesh → solve → post-process pipeline executed by AI agents on ace-linux-2).

Current state: 13 flat files (12 FreeCAD `.FCStd` ship/boat hull models + 1 Blender `CTD.blend`) with a one-line README, sitting untracked at workspace-hub root.

## Why

The repo has a high-leverage mission (AI agents that build FEA models end-to-end) but no structure to support it. Without a proper pipeline layout, agent handoffs, and ecosystem registration, the work will stay isolated and ad hoc. Establishing the foundation now enables WRK-394 (planing hull dynamics) and future structural FEA/CFD work to reuse this infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CAD-DEVELOPMENTS has a pipeline-ready directory layout: `geometry/`, `mesh/`, `analysis/`, `results/`, `agents/`, `docs/`, `specs/`
- [ ] Existing FreeCAD files organised into `geometry/hull/` (boat/ship models) and `geometry/instruments/` (CTD)
- [ ] `README.md` describes mission, pipeline stages, tools, required setup, and collaborator credit
- [ ] `.gitignore` covers FreeCAD/Blender backup files and large solver output files
- [ ] `docs/pipeline.md` — written pipeline spec: stages, tools per stage, agent entry points, I/O contracts
- [ ] `agents/` scaffold: one stub Python file per stage (`geometry_agent.py`, `mesh_agent.py`, `solve_agent.py`, `postprocess_agent.py`)
- [ ] All changes pushed to `bakkiprasad5669/CAD-DEVELOPMENTS` main
- [ ] CAD-DEVELOPMENTS registered as workspace-hub git submodule (`git submodule add …`)
- [ ] Entry in `specs/modules/INDEX.md` for CAD-DEVELOPMENTS (mission, tools, computer)
- [ ] `validate-file-placement.sh` passes on workspace-hub
- [ ] workspace-hub commit: submodule pointer + .gitmodules entry

## Plan

**Route C — Full spec. Two implementation phases.**

### Spec file: `specs/wrk/WRK-610/wrk-610-cad-fea-pipeline-setup.md`

---

### Pipeline Vision

```
User intent / engineering brief
        │
        ▼
[geometry_agent] ─ FreeCAD Python API ──→  geometry/ (.FCStd + STEP exports)
        │
        ▼
[mesh_agent] ─── Gmsh Python API ─────→  mesh/ (.msh files, quality report)
        │
        ▼
[solve_agent] ── CalculiX / FEniCS ───→  analysis/ (.inp / .py definitions)
               / Elmer / OpenFOAM        results/ (gitignored VTK/VTU)
        │
        ▼
[postprocess_agent] ── ParaView CLI ──→  docs/results-summary.md
                     / FreeCAD
```

**Tools available on ace-linux-2**: FreeCAD, Blender, Gmsh, CalculiX, FEniCS, Elmer, OpenFOAM

---

### Phase 1 — Repository restructuring (CAD-DEVELOPMENTS)

**Step 1.1 — Create directory structure**
```
geometry/
  hull/         ← existing ship/boat .FCStd files
  instruments/  ← CTD.blend (Blender) + any instrument geometry
mesh/           ← Gmsh .geo scripts and generated .msh (gitignored)
analysis/
  hull/         ← CalculiX .inp / FEniCS .py per analysis case
results/        ← solver outputs (gitignored)
agents/         ← Python agent stubs for each pipeline stage
docs/           ← pipeline.md, tutorials
specs/          ← material props, BCs, load cases YAML
```

**Step 1.2 — Move files**
- `BOAT.FCStd`, `BOAT1.FCStd`, `b1.FCStd`, `boat profile.FCStd`, `new curved boat.FCStd`, `ship model.FCStd`, `solid ship.FCStd`, `example.FCStd` → `geometry/hull/`
- `Ship macro.FCStd`, `ship macro python console1.FCStd` → `geometry/hull/` (keep as macro examples)
- `ship dim drg re1.FCStd`, `ship drg.new.FCStd` → `geometry/hull/`
- `CTD.blend` → `geometry/instruments/`

**Step 1.3 — `.gitignore`**
```
*.FCStd1
*.FCBak
*.blend1
mesh/*.msh
results/
*.vtk
*.vtu
*.pvd
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
```

**Step 1.4 — `README.md`** (replace "# my-files-")
- Mission statement: AI-agent-driven FEA from scratch
- Pipeline diagram (ASCII)
- Tools + installation (FreeCAD, Gmsh, CalculiX/FEniCS, Blender)
- Directory guide
- Collaborator credit (bakkiprasad5669) + workspace-hub link

**Step 1.5 — `docs/pipeline.md`**
- Full pipeline spec: stages, tools, I/O contracts, agent entry points
- Example workflow: boat hull structural analysis (pressure loads, mesh, CalculiX linear static)

**Step 1.6 — `agents/` scaffold**
Four stub files with docstrings and placeholder `run()` functions:
- `geometry_agent.py` — FreeCAD Python API, parametric geometry generation
- `mesh_agent.py` — Gmsh Python API, mesh size controls, quality checks
- `solve_agent.py` — CalculiX/FEniCS/Elmer dispatch, material + BC injection
- `postprocess_agent.py` — VTK result parsing, summary extraction

**Step 1.7 — Push to `bakkiprasad5669/CAD-DEVELOPMENTS`**

---

### Phase 2 — workspace-hub integration

**Step 2.1 — Register submodule**
```bash
# From workspace-hub root (CAD-DEVELOPMENTS dir already present)
git submodule add https://github.com/bakkiprasad5669/CAD-DEVELOPMENTS CAD-DEVELOPMENTS
```

**Step 2.2 — `specs/modules/INDEX.md`** entry:
| Module | Type | Mission | Tools | Computer |
|--------|------|---------|-------|----------|
| CAD-DEVELOPMENTS | FEA pipeline | AI-agent FEA model development | FreeCAD, Gmsh, CalculiX, FEniCS, Elmer | ace-linux-2 |

**Step 2.3 — Verify + commit**
- `validate-file-placement.sh` passes
- `git submodule status` shows clean pin at HEAD
- Commit: `chore(WRK-610): add CAD-DEVELOPMENTS as AI-agent FEA pipeline submodule`

---

### Test / Verify
- `git submodule status` in workspace-hub: shows `CAD-DEVELOPMENTS` pinned, no `+`/`-`/`U`
- `git status` in CAD-DEVELOPMENTS: clean (after push)
- All 13 source files present under `geometry/hull/` or `geometry/instruments/`
- `agents/geometry_agent.py` importable: `python3 -c "import agents.geometry_agent"`
- `validate-file-placement.sh` on workspace-hub: exit 0

*Plan approved by user: 2026-02-25*

## Agentic AI Horizon

- FreeCAD Python API enables headless geometry generation; agents can parametrically create hull forms from a spec YAML — this scaffold makes that the natural next step (WRK-6xx)
- Gmsh + CalculiX + FEniCS are all scriptable; the pipeline is fully automatable once stubs are in place
- Connects directly to WRK-394 (planing hull strip theory) — hull CAD geometry is the upstream input for hydrodynamic mesh generation
- As AI CAD tools mature (e.g., direct `.FCStd` generation from prompts), the `geometry_agent.py` stub is the insertion point

*Source: review and add CAD-DEVELOPMENTS to the repo workspace-hub ecosystem (mission: AI-agent-driven FEA development from scratch).*
