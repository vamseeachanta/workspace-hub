# doc-index: Review `disciplines/knowledge_skills` — 30K Docs

## What

`disciplines/knowledge_skills` contains 30,814 documents (PDF, docx, pptx, xlsx)
currently classified as `domain=other, target_repos=[]` by the catch-all
`disciplines/knowledge` path rule in `phase-e2-remap.py`. Review sub-directory
structure to determine if sub-folders map to specific repos.

## Why

30K docs is too many to leave as a blanket `other`. Sub-folders likely contain:
technical training guides (→ digitalmodel / worldenergydata), project procedures
(→ acma-projects), general reference (leave as other). Splitting by sub-folder
improves query quality.

## Steps

1. Inspect sub-directory tree:
   ```bash
   find /mnt/ace/docs/disciplines/knowledge_skills -maxdepth 2 -type d | sort
   ls /mnt/ace/docs/disciplines/knowledge_skills/ | sort
   ```
2. For each sub-folder, identify domain relevance:
   - Engineering methods / calculations → `structural` or `marine`, `["digitalmodel"]`
   - Production / reservoir → `energy-economics`, `["worldenergydata"]`
   - Project management → `project-management`, `["acma-projects"]`
   - Training/general → leave as `other, []`
3. Update `PATH_RULES` in `phase-e2-remap.py` with specific sub-folder rules
   **above** the generic `disciplines/knowledge` catch-all
4. Re-run remap (dry-run first), verify, commit

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sub-directory tree documented in WRK body
- [ ] At least one sub-folder reclassified with repo linkage (if applicable)
- [ ] OR confirm all sub-folders are correctly classified as `other` (no-action case)
- [ ] Commit message references WRK-603

## Notes

- Current rule (line ~99 in phase-e2-remap.py):
  `("disciplines/knowledge", None, "other", [], "disciplines_knowledge")`
- New sub-folder rules must be inserted **before** this catch-all
- Target: `/mnt/ace/docs/disciplines/knowledge_skills/` (local to ace-linux-1)
