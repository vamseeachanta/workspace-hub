# NDBC buoy data ingestion for metocean wave scatter matrices

## What

Ingest NOAA NDBC buoy historical wave data (Hs, Tp, direction) and generate wave scatter
matrices and rose plots for metocean analysis. NDBC provides a public API with 40+ years of
data. Output: Hs-Tp scatter table, Weibull fit, directional breakdown.

## Why

Wave scatter matrices are the fundamental input for offshore structural and mooring fatigue
analysis, vessel operability studies, and pipeline stability checks. NDBC provides freely
available, high-quality buoy measurements across the Gulf of Mexico and US coasts. Automating
ingestion and scatter matrix generation eliminates manual data processing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] NDBC historical data downloader (standard meteorological and spectral wave data)
- [x] Data parser handling NDBC text format (multiple historical format versions)
- [x] Hs-Tp scatter matrix generator with configurable bin sizes
- [x] Weibull distribution fit for Hs (2-parameter and 3-parameter)
- [x] Directional wave rose output (Hs by direction sector)
- [x] CLI interface: `worldenergydata ndbc --station 42001 --years 2000-2024`
- [x] Pytest coverage with sample NDBC data files
