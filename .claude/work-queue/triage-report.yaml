  # Key observations:
  notes:
    - "36 of 78 items (46%) were marked high priority -- reduced to 18 (23%) after triage"
    - "4 household chores (WRK-001 to WRK-004) do not belong in this work queue"
    - "2 completed items (WRK-091, WRK-092) are sitting in pending instead of archive"
    - "WRK-087 is a redundant umbrella for existing per-repo test coverage items WRK-051-056"
    - "10 items use non-standard complexity values (moderate, low, high instead of simple/medium/complex)"
    - "WRK-033/034/035 are identical patterns for 3 tools -- should be a single parameterized item"
    - "WRK-018 and WRK-019 have multi-hop dependency chains and should not be high priority"
    - "In-progress items (WRK-067, WRK-068, WRK-071) are correctly prioritized and making progress"
