# Verify `repository_sync` cron job on all workstations

## Summary
WRK-362 implemented no-arg parallel auto-sync for `repository_sync`. The cron job
was set up on **ace-linux-1** (`0 */4 * * *`). All other workstations need the same
cron entry verified or added.

## Cron Entry (to add on each machine)
```
# repository-sync: auto-sync all repos every 4 hours
0 */4 * * * bash /mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/scripts/cron-repository-sync.sh >> /tmp/repository-sync.log 2>&1
```

Note: `WORKSPACE_ROOT` is now derived from script location — no hardcoded path needed.

## Workstations to Verify

- [x] **ace-linux-1** — cron installed 2026-02-24
- [n/a] **ace-linux-2** — mounts ace-linux-1 workspace via SSH; no separate cron needed
- [ ] Any other machines in workstations SKILL.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `crontab -l` on each machine shows the repository-sync entry
- [ ] `bash scripts/repository_sync --dry-run` exits 0 on each machine
- [ ] At least one live run confirmed clean (EXIT:0) on each machine
