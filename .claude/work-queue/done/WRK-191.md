# Field Development Case Study Catalog

## Motivation

We have one case study captured (Aker BP Solveig Phase 2, WRK-190). For the blog post,
NPV calculator, and production engineering module to feel authoritative, they need a
**bench of real field examples** with consistent technical and economic parameters —
not just one project. A structured catalog also makes it easy to add references as new
projects are announced (like Solveig was).

## What

A YAML-driven catalog of real field development case studies stored in
`digitalmodel/docs/modules/references/field_development/catalog/`, with:

- One YAML file per field (`solveig-phase2.yaml`, `edvard-grieg.yaml`, etc.)
- A master index (`index.yaml`) for programmatic lookup
- Companion images/visuals where available (like `aker-bp-solveig-phase2-2026.avif`)
- A Python loader (`digitalmodel/field_development/catalog.py`) that reads and validates entries

## Catalog Schema (per field YAML)

```yaml
id: solveig-phase2
name: Solveig Phase 2
basin: NCS
subregion: Norwegian North Sea
water_depth_m: ~115         # Edvard Grieg area
development_type: subsea_tieback
host_facility: Edvard Grieg
operator: Aker BP
partners:
  - {name: OMV Norge, interest: 0.20}
  - {name: Harbour Energy Norge, interest: 0.15}
sanction_year: 2022
first_oil_date: 2026-02-02
recoverable_resources_mmboe: 39
well_count: 3
tieback_distance_km: 15
plateau_rate_mbopd: null     # not publicly disclosed
key_contractors:
  - {role: subsea_systems, contractor: TechnipFMC}
  - {role: platform_mods, contractor: Moreld Apply}
  - {role: drilling, contractor: Odfjell Drilling}
economics:
  capex_note: "not disclosed; proxy from comparable NCS tiebacks"
  opex_note: "Aker BP 2025 annual report for Edvard Grieg unit cost"

data_sources:
  - {name: NPD Factpages, module: worldenergydata/ncs, wrk: WRK-190}
notes: "Fifth Aker BP project sanctioned 2022 to reach production. Subsea tieback
  leverages existing Edvard Grieg processing capacity to extend plateau."
```

## Priority Fields to Catalog (initial set)

| Field | Basin | Type | Why |
|-------|-------|------|
-----|
| Solveig Phase 2 | NCS | Subsea tieback | Done — convert to YAML |
| Edvard Grieg | NCS | Semi platform | Host facility; production history since 2015 |
| Johan Sverdrup | NCS | Platform complex | Largest NCS field; NPV benchmark |
| Valhall | NCS | Platform | Mature NCS field; decline curve study |
| Atlantis | GoM | Semi + subsea | BP deepwater; BSEE data available |
| Mad Dog Phase 2 (Argos) | GoM | Semi | First oil 2023; recent tieback economics |
| Buckskin | GoM | FPSO tieback | Already in worldenergydata WRK-024 |
| Stones (Shell) | GoM | FPSO | Deepest GoM development; subsea tieback |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Catalog schema defined and documented (`catalog/schema.yaml`)
- [ ] At least 6 fields cataloged in YAML (covering NCS + GoM)
- [ ] `catalog.py` loader with validation (required fields, type checks)
- [ ] Index YAML for lookup by basin, development_type, operator
- [ ] Solveig entry created from existing reference files
- [ ] Linked from WRK-080 Phase 2 and WRK-081 calculator defaults

## Plan Notes

### Phase 1 — Schema + Loader
- Define YAML schema; write Pydantic model for validation
- `FieldCaseStudy` dataclass with optional economics fields
- `CatalogLoader.by_basin()`, `.by_type()`, `.by_operator()` convenience methods

### Phase 2 — Populate Catalog
- Convert Solveig reference markdown → YAML
- Research and add 5 more fields (NPD Factpages + public operator reports)
- Flag economics fields as "proxy" vs. "disclosed"

### Phase 3 — Integration
- WRK-081 calculator: expose catalog fields as dropdown scenario presets
- WRK-080 Phase 2: pull Solveig parameters from catalog programmatically

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Field development case study catalog provides structured reference data for agent-driven project comparisons and client presentations — moderate compounding value.
- Research and catalogue compilation will be significantly better with improved web-search and synthesis agents in 3–4 months.
- **Disposition: park 2-3 months** — a research-heavy task that benefits directly from better synthesis agents; revisit April 2026 for a much richer result.
