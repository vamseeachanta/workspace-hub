# governance(review): align orchestrator flow & scripts

## Problem

WRK-669/670/671 showed each orchestrator running the canonical gates, but the flow and script usage are documented separately. To keep the WRK-624 contract strong we must ensure the same high-value scripts and flow are adopted across Claude, Codex, and Gemini, and that we continuously improve the most successful helpers.

## What

Compare the `/work run` flow, wrappers, and scripts used by each orchestrator, identify the variants, and codify the “most successful” patterns. Define a reference script suite (plan, cross-review, watchdog, validator, log-gate-event) that every orchestrator should call; document it in `assets/WRK-656/orchestrator-flow.md` and update the comparison HTML. Emphasize reuse of the best-performing scripts while noting where agent-specific adjustments remain necessary.

## Plan

- Phase 1 — Inventory: after 10 additional WRKs each for Claude and Codex have run, capture the `/work run`, plan, cross-review, watchdog, and validator invocations from the Claude/Codex/Gemini runs (logs + summary HTML).
- Phase 2 — Analysis: once the extended set of runs exists, identify discrepancies (e.g., Claude-specific submit-to-claude.sh usage vs. Codex/Gemini reliance on the standard wrapper) and pick the highest-value script patterns to promote.
- Phase 3 — Documentation: author `assets/WRK-656/orchestrator-flow.md` with the agreed sequence and annotate `assets/WRK-656/wrk-656-orchestrator-comparison.html` to highlight the canonical flow; call out any agent-specific deviations and next improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Inventory table showing the flow/scripts each orchestrator actually ran.
- [ ] `assets/WRK-656/orchestrator-flow.md` describes the canonical orchestrator flow plus script list.
- [ ] Comparison HTML references the new canonical flow and notes ongoing improvement targets.
- [ ] Work item captures follow-on actions for improving the most successful scripts (recorded in the new doc).

## Evidence

- `assets/WRK-656/orchestrator-flow.md`
- `assets/WRK-656/wrk-656-orchestrator-comparison.html`
- `.claude/work-queue/logs/WRK-669-*.log`
- `.claude/work-queue/logs/WRK-670-*.log`
- `.claude/work-queue/logs/WRK-671-*.log`

## Outcome

A canonical orchestrator flow is documented, the high-value scripts are highlighted for continuous improvement, and the comparison artifact explicitly reports whether quiet deviations remain necessary for specific agents.
