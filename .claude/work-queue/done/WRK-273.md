# CP Marketing Brochure — Cathodic Protection Capability Document

## What

Create a marketing brochure for A&CE's cathodic protection engineering capability.
Blocked by WRK-271 (worked examples) — the brochure references real calculation
outputs and demonstrated capabilities, not generic claims.

## Why

CP is A&CE's core corrosion prevention capability. No brochure exists. The FFS brochure
(WRK-206 done) covers damage assessment (what happens when corrosion occurs); CP covers
prevention (stopping it). Together they tell the complete corrosion management story
for a client.

## Output

`digitalmodel/docs/marketing/cathodic-protection-brochure.md`

### Content structure

1. **Capability statement** — what A&CE delivers in CP engineering
2. **Standards coverage** — DNV-RP-B401, DNV-RP-F103, ABS GN Ships/Offshore (versions confirmed per WRK-269)
3. **Structure types** — pipelines, ship hulls, offshore jackets, subsea equipment (scope per WRK-271/272 completions)
4. **What we calculate** — anode mass, count, spacing, current demand, design life, coating breakdown
5. **Worked example reference** — link to Example 1/2/3 from WRK-271 with summary result table
6. **Integration with FFS** — CP (prevention) + FFS (damage assessment) = complete integrity lifecycle
7. **Typical deliverables** — CP design report, anode schedule, inspection and monitoring plan

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Brochure created at `digitalmodel/docs/marketing/cathodic-protection-brochure.md`
- [x] References at least 2 worked examples from WRK-271 (all 3 examples referenced)
- [x] Standards table accurate per WRK-269 inventory (DNV-RP-F103:2010, ABS GN Ships Dec 2017, ABS GN Offshore Dec 2018, DNV-RP-B401 reference)
- [ ] `see_also:` links to FFS brochure (FFS brochure not yet created — placeholder prose added pointing to docs/marketing/)
- [x] Reviewed for legal compliance (legal-sanity-scan.sh exit 0 — no violations)
- [x] `brochure_status` on WRK-273 set to `pending` (triggers aceengineer-website sync)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Brochure content is stable; no reason to defer once examples exist
- Gemini is strong for polished prose generation from structured inputs
- **Disposition: park until WRK-271 done, then Route A**
