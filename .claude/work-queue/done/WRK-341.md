# Review pdf-large-reader vs native AI agent PDF capabilities — assess continuation or deprecation

## What

pdf-large-reader was built when AI agents lacked native PDF reading. Claude and other agents
now have native PDF capabilities. Assess: (1) what pdf-large-reader does that native agents
cannot (large files >100MB, 1000+ pages, streaming), (2) continued investment plan or
deprecation decision, (3) if kept, identify unique value proposition for next WRK items.

## Why

Maintaining a tool that duplicates native AI agent capabilities is wasteful. However,
pdf-large-reader may still have unique value for edge cases (very large files, structured
extraction, batch processing) that native capabilities do not cover. This assessment ensures
resources are directed appropriately.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Document current pdf-large-reader capabilities (features, file size limits, formats)
- [x] Document current native AI agent PDF capabilities (Claude, Codex, Gemini)
- [x] Gap analysis: what pdf-large-reader does that native agents cannot
- [x] Decision: continue, pivot, or deprecate
- [x] If continue: identify 2-3 WRK items for unique value proposition development
- [x] If deprecate: migration plan for any dependent workflows
- [x] Decision documented in specs/ with rationale

## Decision Notes

**Decision: KEEP** (2026-02-24)

pdf-large-reader occupies a non-duplicated technical niche: memory-efficient, headless,
deterministic processing of large PDFs (>32MB / >100 pages) with structured output and CLI
integration for automated batch workflows. Native AI agents (Claude, GPT-4.1) are capped at
~32MB file size and ~100 pages per request — they cannot process the engineering standards
and project documents targeted by WRK-309.

The two capabilities are complementary: native AI is preferred for interactive Q&A on
small documents (<50 pages); pdf-large-reader is required for batch, large-file, and
structured-extraction use cases.

**Recommended follow-on WRK items** (see spec for full scope):
- WRK-A: OCR pipeline — Tesseract integration for scanned engineering drawings
- WRK-B: Structured table extraction enhancement (camelot/pdfplumber upgrade)
- WRK-C: Standards cross-reference extractor (clause reference graph)
