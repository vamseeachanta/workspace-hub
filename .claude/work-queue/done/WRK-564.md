# docs(doris): Add Calc Examples Mapping — Pipeline Design Calcs

## What

Add a `calc_examples` section to `specs/data-sources/doris.yaml` linking real
project pipeline design calculation files to the doris gaps (DNV-OS-F101 pressure
containment, API-RP-1111 wall thickness, DNV-RP-F109 on-bottom stability).

Also review and update `specs/data-sources/doris.yaml` — the current file may be
sparse; add any doris-specific standards with their paths from the index.

## Why

Doris is the primary pipeline design calculation repo. All calculation Excel files
in the pipeline domain of the index should be mapped here so doris developers know
what reference implementations exist when coding new checks.

## Steps

1. Read current `specs/data-sources/doris.yaml`
2. Query `scripts/readiness/query-docs.sh --domain pipeline --status gap` for doris-relevant calcs
3. Search index for pipeline calc files with doc-number patterns in `/mnt/ace/docs/` and `/mnt/dde/`
4. For each major calculation type (pressure containment, wall thickness, propagation,
   on-bottom stability, upheaval buckling), find 3-5 representative project calc files
5. Add `calc_examples:` section to doris.yaml
6. Search for any additional pipeline standards in `/mnt/ace/0000 O&G/` not yet in doris.yaml

## Key Pipeline Calc Categories to Map

- Pressure containment (SMYS/SMTS-based wall thickness): DNV OS F101 Sec 5
- Propagation buckle initiation/arrest: API RP 1111 Sec 4
- On-bottom stability (hydrodynamic loads): DNV RP F109
- Upheaval buckling (DNV RP F110 - pipeline expansion)
- Pipelay S-lay tensioner calcs: DNV OS F101 / installation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `specs/data-sources/doris.yaml` updated with `calc_examples` section
- [ ] At least 10 calc files mapped across the 5 pipeline calculation categories
- [ ] File paths verified accessible from ace-linux-1 (or note dde host)
- [ ] Any doris standards not yet in YAML added as `status: gap`
- [ ] Legal scan passes
