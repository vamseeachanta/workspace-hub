# doc(review): finish Gemini orchestrator summary and variation tests

## Problem

WRK-671’s Gemini orchestrator run satisfies the gate contract, but its variation-test narrative and review artifacts are placeholder text. The comparison HTML advertises a simulated execute stage, so readers cannot verify the actual scripts or test evidence. Because WRK-624’s workflow leaves the next WRK adoption to user decision, we must manually add this follow-up item.

## What

Replace the placeholder variation-test entry with real smoke-test output, expand the review HTML to include the required sections (Verdict, Summary, Issues Found, Suggestions, Questions), and ensure the summary HTML used in WRK-656 references the new Gemini details. Capture the evidence in `assets/WRK-671/` (variation tests, review HTML, HTML verification) and rerun `verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-671` if anything changes.

## Plan

- Phase 1 — Variation-test capture: rerun the relevant wrapper scripts, document their commands/results in `assets/WRK-671/variation-test-results.md`, and confirm no orphaned processes remain.
- Phase 2 — Review artifact cleanup: regenerate `assets/WRK-671/review.html` with real verdict information, update `review-codex.md`/`review-claude.md`/`review-gemini.md` if required, and note the review status inside `claim-evidence.yaml`.
- Phase 3 — Comparison sync: update `assets/WRK-656/wrk-656-orchestrator-comparison.html` to link to the new Gemini summary, confirm the variation-test narrative lines up, and snapshot the validator output if rerunning is needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `assets/WRK-671/variation-test-results.md` includes explicit commands/results instead of placeholder text.
- [ ] `assets/WRK-671/review.html` meets the WRK-624 review artifact requirements (Verdict, Summary, Issues, Suggestions, Questions).
- [ ] `assets/WRK-656/wrk-656-orchestrator-comparison.html` now links to the updated Gemini summary and reflects the real test evidence.
- [ ] `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-671` runs passing, with output recorded in `assets/WRK-671/verify-gate-evidence.txt`.

## Evidence

- `assets/WRK-671/variation-test-results.md`
- `assets/WRK-671/review.html`
- `assets/WRK-671/claim-evidence.yaml`
- `.claude/work-queue/logs/WRK-671-*.log`
- `assets/WRK-656/wrk-656-orchestrator-comparison.html`

## Outcome

Gemini’s orchestrator run will stand toe-to-toe with Claude and Codex, making the comparison more reliable and preventing confusion caused by placeholders.
