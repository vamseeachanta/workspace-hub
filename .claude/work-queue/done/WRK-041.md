# Develop long-term plan for Hobbies repo

## What
Create a long-term plan/roadmap for the Hobbies repository — defining its purpose, structure, content goals, and development direction.

## Why
A clear long-term plan provides direction for the repo, prevents aimless accumulation, and ensures the repo serves its intended purpose effectively over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Review current state of the Hobbies repo (content, structure, activity)
- [x] Define the repo's purpose and scope
- [x] Outline long-term goals and milestones
- [x] Plan documented and committed to the repo

## Plan

### Current State Assessment

The hobbies repo is a personal knowledge management system with the following actual content:

- **gardening/**: 4 markdown files (mango, watermelon, dosakai, drumstick growing guides)
- **sports/**: swimming (freestyle, training, healthy practices, individual swimmer profiles), soccer (literature PDFs, soccer.md), cycling (Stumpjumper PDF), volleyball and waterpolo dirs (empty or minimal)
- **arts-music/**: theory subdir (minimal content)
- **autism/**: 1 Medicaid resources PDF
- **cultural/**: 1 file (bala_vihar.md)
- **sdev/**: 2 files (50 golden rules, visualization guides)

The repo has significant scaffolding bloat: `.agent-os/`, `.claude-flow/`, `.hive-mind/`, `.swarm/`, `agents/`, `coordination/`, `scripts/automation/`, `htmlcov/`, and various boilerplate files (`MANDATORY_SLASH_COMMAND_ECOSYSTEM.md`, `AGENT_OS_COMMANDS.md`, `COMMANDS.md`, `create-spec*.py`, `execute-tasks.py`, `slash_commands.py`). This scaffolding vastly outweighs the actual hobby content.

### Phase 1: Audit and Inventory (1 session)

1. Generate a complete file listing of actual content (exclude scaffolding dirs)
2. Read each content markdown file to assess depth and quality
3. Count files per category, identify gaps vs. the CLAUDE.md declared structure
4. Document findings in `hobbies/docs/repo-audit.md`

### Phase 2: Define Purpose and Scope (1 session)

1. Determine primary use case: personal/family knowledge base vs. publishable reference
2. Decide which categories are active vs. dormant:
   - Active (has content): gardening, sports/swimming, sports/soccer, cultural, autism, sdev
   - Dormant (empty/minimal): arts-music, sports/volleyball, sports/waterpolo, sports/tennis, sports/cycling
3. Decide if dormant categories should be removed or kept as placeholders
4. Update `hobbies/README.md` with clear purpose statement (currently just `# hobbies`)

### Phase 3: Clean Up Scaffolding (1 session)

1. Remove or consolidate boilerplate that adds no value to a documentation repo:
   - Evaluate removing: `.agent-os/`, `.hive-mind/`, `.swarm/`, `agents/` (all contain only sample/template files)
   - Evaluate removing: `coordination/`, `modules/`, `htmlcov/`, `.benchmarks/`, `.drcode/`
   - Evaluate removing: root-level Python scripts (`create-spec*.py`, `execute-tasks.py`, `slash_commands.py`)
2. Simplify `CLAUDE.md` to reflect actual repo nature (documentation, not a software project)
3. Keep `.claude/` config if workspace-hub integration is desired

### Phase 4: Roadmap and Structure (1 session)

1. Define content goals per category with milestones:
   - **gardening/**: Expand to cover full season (spring planting through harvest), add zone/soil notes
   - **sports/swimming/**: Add competition schedules, stroke technique references
   - **sports/soccer/**: Add training drills, league info
   - **autism/**: Expand beyond single PDF to include IEP resources, therapy tracking, community links
   - **cultural/**: Expand Bala Vihar with curriculum notes, event calendar
   - **sdev/**: Decide if this belongs here or in a dedicated dev-learning repo
2. Write the roadmap document at `hobbies/docs/roadmap.md`
3. Consider future static site generation (Jekyll/Hugo) as noted in CLAUDE.md

### Target Files

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|
------|
| Audit report | `hobbies/docs/repo-audit.md` |
| Updated README | `hobbies/README.md` |
| Roadmap | `hobbies/docs/roadmap.md` |
| Simplified CLAUDE.md | `hobbies/CLAUDE.md` |

### Review Notes

**Cross-review date**: 2026-02-10

| Reviewer | Verdict |
|----------|
---------|
| Claude Opus 4.6 | APPROVE |
| Gemini CLI | APPROVE |
| Codex CLI | NO_OUTPUT |

**Feedback incorporated**:
- Content inventory accurate, scaffolding bloat confirmed
- sdev/ has 8 items vs plan's "2 files" claim (minor undercount)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Personal hobbies repo planning; minimal ecosystem agentic capability boost.
- Planning and structuring a personal repo is exactly the kind of lightweight task agents will handle autonomously with better context retention in 3–4 months.
- **Disposition: deprioritise** — low strategic value; revisit only if the hobbies repo becomes a platform for capability demonstration or has cross-ecosystem utility.
