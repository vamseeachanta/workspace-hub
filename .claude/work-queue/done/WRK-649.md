# validate(review): Rerun Full-Bundle Claude Review to Natural 120s Timeout

## Problem

`WRK-648` established that the full-bundle Claude review path was not operationally
viable within the bounded wrapper run, but the run was terminated manually before
allowing the full 120-second timeout budget to expire naturally. That leaves avoidable
ambiguity in the evidence.

## What

Rerun the full-bundle Claude review on `specs/wrk/WRK-624/plan.md` and allow the
full 120-second timeout to expire naturally.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Full-bundle Claude review is rerun on `specs/wrk/WRK-624/plan.md`
- [x] Process is allowed to run to the natural 120-second timeout or complete earlier
- [x] Exit code, stdout, stderr, and artifact classification are captured
- [x] HTML review artifact exists for user inspection

## Evidence

- Review artifact: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-649/raw/claude-review-full.md`
- Results: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-649/results.md`
- HTML review artifact: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-649/review.html`

## Outcome

The natural-timeout rerun completed in 76 seconds and returned a valid full-bundle
Claude review artifact. This shows the earlier manual-stop conclusion from
`WRK-648` was too aggressive; full-bundle review is viable when allowed to finish.
