# The Well — acoustic_scattering Datasets for Subsea NDE Validation

## What

Integrate The Well's `acoustic_scattering` datasets (3 variants: basic, maze, multi-scatter)
into `digitalmodel` as benchmark data for subsea Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) and
inspection analysis. These datasets simulate acoustic wave scattering around obstacles —
directly relevant to ultrasonic inspection of subsea structures.

The Well package: `pip install the_well` (v1.2.0, CC BY 4.0)
Datasets: `acoustic_scattering`, `acoustic_scattering_maze`, `acoustic_scattering_inclusions`

## Why

WRK-393 identified acoustic scattering as top-3 integration candidate. Subsea inspection
and NDE uses ultrasonic/acoustic methods to detect corrosion, cracks, and wall loss.
Having physics-accurate acoustic scattering simulation data enables:
- Validating digitalmodel NDE analysis modules against ground-truth physics
- Training defect detection models with synthetic acoustic data
- Benchmarking acoustic signal processing algorithms

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `the_well` added to digitalmodel optional deps (`[nde]` extras group)
- [x] `digitalmodel/nde/well_acoustic/` module with `AcousticScatteringLoader`
- [x] `AcousticScatteringLoader.stream_sample(variant="basic", n_steps=10)` works
- [x] Integration test: streams 10 steps for each of 3 variants (streaming, no full download)
- [x] Example: `docs/examples/acoustic_nde_validation.py`
- [x] Attribution: CC BY 4.0 in all files
- [x] Tests pass in digitalmodel pytest suite (25/25)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Acoustic simulation data fills a critical gap: NDE validation without expensive lab equipment
- Once integrated, agents can validate acoustic analysis routines automatically
- **Disposition: invest now** — direct subsea inspection relevance, low integration friction
