# doc-index: Triage `_standards/raw/` — Reclassify 24K PDFs

## What

`_standards/raw/` on `/mnt/ace/docs/` contains ~24,583 PDFs intentionally excluded
from Phase E2 remap (deferred for manual inspection). Inspect subdirectory structure,
add targeted path rules to `phase-e2-remap.py`, and re-run to classify.

## Why

Largest single unclassified bucket in the document index. Most likely engineering
standards (API, ASTM, ISO, DNV etc.) in a raw/unsorted dump. Classifying turns them
queryable via `query-docs.sh`.

## Steps

1. Inspect sub-directory tree (depth 2–3):
   ```bash
   ls /mnt/ace/docs/_standards/raw/ | sort | head -50
   find /mnt/ace/docs/_standards/raw -maxdepth 2 -type d | sort
   ```
2. Identify dominant sub-patterns (e.g. `raw/API/`, `raw/DNV/`, `raw/unsorted/`)
3. Add path rules to `PATH_RULES` in `phase-e2-remap.py` **above** existing
   `_standards/ASTM` rules (most-specific first)
4. Dry-run: `uv run --no-project python scripts/data/document-index/phase-e2-remap.py --dry-run`
5. Verify rule hits, run for real, commit `phase-e2-remap.py` + `registry.yaml`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `_standards/raw/` sub-directory tree documented in WRK body
- [ ] New path rules added for all identifiable sub-patterns
- [ ] Remove `"_standards/raw/"` from `SKIP_PATH_FRAGMENTS` after adding rules
- [ ] Remap re-run; `_standards/raw/other` bucket reduced by ≥ 80%
- [ ] `registry.yaml` updated domain counts committed

## Notes

- FILENAME_RULES already catch standards by prefix (API, DNV, ASTM, ISO, etc.) — many
  will auto-classify once the `_standards/raw` SKIP is removed, even without new path rules
- Path: `/mnt/ace/docs/_standards/raw/` (local to ace-linux-1)
