# docs(review): Codify Claude Full-vs-Compact Bundle Policy in Workflow Spec

## Problem

Recent validation work established that Claude review transport now works through
the patched temp-file `Read` path. Both review-input modes are viable for
`WRK-624`:
- compact bundle: faster, but can omit important context
- full bundle: slower, but yields more substantive review findings

The workflow/spec should explicitly capture this tradeoff and define when each
mode should be used.

## What

Update the workflow/spec and review documentation so Claude review mode selection
is explicit and policy-driven.

## Scope

1. document that compact and full bundle modes are both valid
2. define default selection criteria
3. specify when full bundle should be preferred
4. specify when compact bundle is acceptable
5. produce an HTML review artifact for user inspection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Workflow/spec documents both Claude review input modes
- [x] Default selection criteria are explicit
- [x] Tradeoffs are documented clearly
- [x] HTML review artifact exists for user inspection

## Evidence

- Spec update: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/specs/wrk/WRK-624/plan.md`
- HTML review surface: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/assets/WRK-624/wrk-624-workflow-review.html`

## Outcome

The workflow/spec now codifies both valid Claude review input modes:
- full bundle for higher-quality, full-context review
- compact bundle for faster, lower-latency screening

The policy now makes the default and fallback tradeoff explicit instead of
leaving it implicit in the experiment history.
