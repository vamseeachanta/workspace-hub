# Integrated web dashboard — Plotly Dash for BSEE and FDAS data

## What

Build a Plotly Dash web application exposing BSEE production data, platform data, and FDAS
incident data. Interactive maps (GOM platforms), production trend charts, incident severity
heatmaps. Serve locally; add to CLI launcher.

## Why

worldenergydata has rich BSEE and FDAS datasets but no interactive visualisation layer.
A Dash application enables rapid exploration of production trends, platform locations, and
safety incident patterns without writing custom query code each time. This makes the data
accessible for engineering analysis and decision support.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Plotly Dash application with multi-tab layout (Production, Platforms, Incidents)
- [x] Interactive GOM map: platform locations coloured by production status or incident count
- [x] Production trend charts: oil/gas/water by field, lease, or operator (selectable)
- [x] FDAS incident severity heatmap: incident type vs. year, filterable by area/operator
- [x] CLI launcher: `worldenergydata dashboard` starts local server
- [x] Dependencies added to pyproject.toml (dash, plotly, pandas)
- [x] Basic pytest coverage for data loading and layout callbacks (33 tests, all passing)
