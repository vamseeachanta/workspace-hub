# improve(workflow): Reduce WRK Explosion for Exploratory and Diagnostic Chains

## Problem

The current workflow contract is too granular for exploratory review/debugging work.
A single continuous investigation can turn into many narrowly scoped WRKs, which
preserves auditability but adds too much bookkeeping overhead and fragments one
logical effort into many queue items.

## What

Update the workflow/spec so bounded exploratory, diagnostic, retry, and synthesis
steps can remain under one approved parent WRK unless they become a genuinely
separate backlog item.

## Scope

1. define an exploration-chain policy in the canonical workflow
2. specify when sub-steps stay inside a parent WRK
3. specify when a new WRK is still required
4. update review HTML so the policy is visible to the user

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Workflow/spec documents exploration-chain policy
- [x] Criteria for keeping work inside parent WRK are explicit
- [x] Criteria for splitting into new WRKs are explicit
- [x] Review HTML reflects the new policy

## Evidence

- Spec update: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/specs/wrk/WRK-624/plan.md`
- HTML review surface: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/assets/WRK-624/wrk-624-workflow-review.html`

## Outcome

The canonical workflow now explicitly allows bounded exploratory, diagnostic, retry,
and synthesis chains to remain inside one approved parent WRK. New WRKs are now
reserved for true branch points, separate deliverables, or deferred standalone work.
