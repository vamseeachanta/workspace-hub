# Audit and improve agent performance files across Claude, Codex, and Gemini

## What

Review all agent-facing performance and context files for each provider in the ecosystem — the files that directly shape how each AI agent behaves, what it knows at session start, and how effectively it operates. For Claude this includes `CLAUDE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, rules, and skills. For Codex and Gemini, identify and review equivalent files.

## Why

These files are the primary levers for agent quality. Stale, bloated, or missing instructions lead to repeated mistakes, wasted tokens, and poor orchestration. A periodic audit ensures each provider has accurate, concise, high-signal context — and that cross-provider parity is maintained where it matters (e.g., legal rules, security policy, git workflow).

## Scope

### Claude
- `CLAUDE.md` (project-level, workspace-hub root)
- `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` and topic files (`engineering-modules.md`, `ai-orchestration.md`, `shell-git-patterns.md`)
- `.claude/rules/*.md` (security, testing, coding-style, git-workflow, patterns, legal-compliance)
- Key skill files: `work-queue/SKILL.md`, `process.md`, `behavior-contract.yaml`

### Codex
- `.codex/AGENTS.md` or equivalent project instructions
- `.codex/skills/` (symlinks or copies of skills)
- Any memory or rules files under `.codex/`

### Gemini
- `.gemini/GEMINI.md` or equivalent
- `.gemini/skills/`
- Any memory or rules files under `.gemini/`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Catalogue all agent performance files per provider (Claude / Codex / Gemini)
- [ ] Identify files that are stale, missing, overly long, or inconsistent across providers
- [ ] Check cross-provider parity for critical rules (security, legal, git workflow)
- [ ] Produce specific improvement recommendations (with diffs or rewrites where needed)
- [ ] Apply agreed improvements — update/trim files, fill gaps, fix inconsistencies
- [ ] Document findings in `.claude/docs/agent-performance-audit.md`

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Auditing and improving agent performance files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md) directly improves every session's agent quality — high ecosystem compounding value.
- Agent instruction quality directly determines session output quality; this work has immediate and lasting impact.
- **Disposition: invest now** — already working; performance file quality compounds across every session; close this item and establish a review cadence.
