# feat(calculations): implement OTC2001-13109 SCR Fatigue at Low KC

## Standard
- **ID**: OTC2001-13109 SCR Fatigue at Low KC
- **Title**: OTC2001 13109 SCR Fatigue at Low KC
- **Org**: Offshore Technology Conference
- **Document**: `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/OnePetro/OTC2001-13109_SCR_Fatigue_at_Low_KC.pdf` (SHA: `a0d1e612b7b715fb...`)
- **Summary**: This document investigates hydrodynamic coefficients for bare and straked pipes in oscillatory flows at low Keulegan-Carpenter and high Beta numbers. It provides experimental data from MIT tow tank...
- **Discipline**: structural

## Target Module
- **Repo**: assetutilities
- **Module**: `calculations`
- **Current status**: gap (no implementation found)
- **Capability tier target**: Tier 1 (deterministic calculation)

## What to Implement
This document investigates hydrodynamic coefficients for bare and straked pipes in oscillatory flows at low Keulegan-Carpenter and high Beta numbers. It provides experimental data from MIT tow tank tests used to accurately predict global motion response and fatigue life for the Typhoon TLP steel catenary riser. The findings demonstrate significant sensitivity of fatigue life calculations to dra...
