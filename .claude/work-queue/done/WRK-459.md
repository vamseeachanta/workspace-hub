# feat(calculations): implement Gardner, T.N., et al, 1982 - Deepwate...

## Standard
- **ID**: Gardner, T.N., et al, 1982 - Deepwater Drilling in High Cur
- **Title**: Gardner, T.N., et al, 1982   Deepwater Drilling in High Cur
- **Org**: Unknown
- **Document**: `` (SHA: `423dc902cf91ffba...`)
- **Summary**: Papers Offshore Technology Conference Gardner, T.N., et al, 1982 - Deepwater Drilling in High Cur.pdf
- **Discipline**: marine

## Target Module
- **Repo**: assetutilities
- **Module**: `calculations`
- **Current status**: gap (no implementation found)
- **Capability tier target**: Tier 1 (deterministic calculation)

## What to Implement
Papers Offshore Technology Conference Gardner, T.N., et al, 1982 - Deepwater Drilling in High Cur.pdf

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Function implements Gardner, T.N., et al, 1982 - Deepwate... calculation
- [ ] Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases
- [ ] Result validated against worked example in standard (if available)
- [ ] Module registry updated: status → implemented

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Standards implementation is direct engineering value: agents can invoke
  Gardner, T.N., et al, 1982 - Deepwate... calculations in automated workflows
- **Disposition: invest now** — engineering standards code is foundational
  and non-perishable
