## Context
Auto-created by comprehensive-learning analysis.

## Description
Correction Trend Analysis detected increasing trend.
This week: 30
Last week: 10
4-week avg: 14.5

## Root Cause
Write corrections at 30/week triggered escalation because 30 > 10 * 1.5 (the
existing threshold).  However, actual Write correction volume is low (8-9 genuine
corrections/week after noise filtering).  The escalation fired on low-volume noise.

## Fix Applied (2026-02-24)
`scripts/analysis/comprehensive_learning_pipeline.py` — `phase_5_correction_trend_analysis()`:

1. Added `MIN_WEEKLY_COUNT_TO_ESCALATE = 10` guard: no WRK item is created
   unless the filtered correction count exceeds 10/week.  Write at 8-9/week
   (after chain-noise filtering) is suppressed.

2. Added chain-noise filter (`MIN_CORRECTION_GAP_S = 60`,
   `MIN_CHAIN_POSITION_THRESHOLD = 2`): corrections spaced < 60 s apart
   at chain position > 2 are sequential workflow edits, not genuine mistakes.
