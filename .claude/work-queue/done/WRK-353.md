# Expand S-N curve library from 17 to 20 standards

## What

Extend digitalmodel's fatigue S-N curve library to include BS 7608 (revised), ISO 19902 annex,
and DNVGL-RP-C203 (latest). Currently 17 standard curves are implemented. Add 3 more covering
steel structures and offshore applications.

## Why

The current S-N library covers the most common offshore fatigue standards but is missing key
curves for UK-origin steel structure assessments (BS 7608), the ISO fixed platform standard
(ISO 19902 annex), and the latest revision of the DNV fatigue recommended practice
(DNVGL-RP-C203). Adding these expands coverage for structural fatigue assessments across
international codes.

## Standards

- BS 7608
- ISO 19902
- DNVGL-RP-C203

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] BS 7608 (revised) S-N curves added with class definitions and thickness correction
- [ ] ISO 19902 annex S-N curves added with environment factors (air, seawater, CP)
- [ ] DNVGL-RP-C203 (latest) S-N curves added with SCF integration
- [ ] All new curves have pytest coverage with known hand-calc verification points
- [ ] S-N library count verified at 20 standards in test suite
