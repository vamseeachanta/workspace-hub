# Shared engineering constants library — material properties unit conversions seawater properties

## What

Extract engineering constants from digitalmodel and centralise as a shared library accessible
to all repos. Material properties (steel grades, density, E, nu, Fy), seawater properties
(rho, mu vs temperature/salinity), unit conversion tables. Install via pyproject.toml.

## Why

Engineering constants are currently duplicated across multiple repos. Centralising them
ensures consistency (one source of truth for steel yield strength, seawater density, etc.),
reduces copy-paste errors, and provides a stable foundation for all engineering calculations
across the workspace.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Shared library package: `assetutilities.constants` (existing package, extended with new modules)
- [x] Steel material properties: API 5L grades (X42-X80), structural steel (A36, A572) — frozen dataclasses in `assetutilities/constants/materials.py`
- [x] Seawater properties: density and viscosity as functions of temperature and salinity — `assetutilities/constants/seawater.py`
- [x] Unit conversion utilities: SI/Imperial for common engineering units — `assetutilities/constants/conversions.py` (pre-existing)
- [x] Constants are immutable (frozen dataclasses or similar) — SteelGrade is `@dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)`
- [x] digitalmodel updated to import from shared library — `digitalmodel/infrastructure/base_solvers/structural/config.py` imports E_STEEL, NU_STEEL, RHO_STEEL, FY_A36
- [x] Pytest coverage with known material property values from code references — 50 new tests in `tests/unit/test_materials.py` and `tests/unit/test_seawater.py`

## Implementation Notes (2026-02-24)

- New modules: `assetutilities/src/assetutilities/constants/materials.py` (SteelGrade frozen dataclass + STEEL_GRADES registry) and `seawater.py` (UNESCO IES 80 density + ITTC 2011 viscosity)
- Tests: 116 total constants tests pass (66 existing + 34 materials + 16 seawater)
- digitalmodel: `infrastructure/base_solvers/structural/config.py` now imports from assetutilities.constants
- Legal scan: PASS
- Cross-review: attempted; Codex API unavailable (gpt-4.1 not supported); Claude/Gemini timed out — environment limitation
