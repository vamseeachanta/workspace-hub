# Evaluate Polymathic AI — The Well for Ecosystem Integration

## What

Review [The Well](https://polymathic-ai.org/the_well/) — a 15 TB open physics simulation
dataset collection (16+ datasets, pip-installable Python API, PyTorch DataLoader, Hugging
Face streaming) — and produce a structured evaluation identifying which datasets, benchmark
models, and tooling are worth integrating into the workspace-hub ecosystem. Output:
an entry in `specs/online-resources/catalog.yaml` (WRK-391) plus a standalone evaluation
note at `specs/online-resources/the-well-evaluation.md`.

## Why

The Well is a curated, high-quality corpus of physics simulation data covering fluid
dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, acoustic scattering, turbulence, and reaction-diffusion
systems. Several of these domains directly overlap with current and planned modules:

- **Fluid dynamics** (Rayleigh-Bénard, Euler equations, shear flow, turbulence) — training
  data and benchmarks for CFD-adjacent ML modules on ace-linux-2
- **Rayleigh-Taylor instability, viscoelastic instability** — relevant to structural and
  materials integrity modelling
- **MHD (64 and 256 resolution)** — relevant to electromagnetic and corrosion physics
- **Acoustic scattering** — relevant to subsea inspection and NDE (non-destructive evaluation)
- **Planetary SWE (shallow water equations)** — metocean / oceanographic wave modelling
  crossover; potential supplement to `worldenergydata/metocean/`
- **Benchmark suite** (FNO and other neural operator models) — ready-made ML baselines
  that could seed ML capability in `digitalmodel` or a future `ml-engineering` module

The pip package (`pip install the_well`) and Hugging Face streaming make integration
low-friction — no bulk download required to prototype.

## Datasets Inventory (for evaluation)

| Dataset | Domain | Size (approx) | Relevance |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| `rayleigh_benard` / `rayleigh_benard_uniform` | Fluid dynamics (convection) | — | CFD ML training |
| `euler_multi_quadrants_openBC/periodicBC` | Compressible fluid dynamics | — | CFD ML |
| `rayleigh_taylor_instability` | Fluid instability | — | Structural / materials |
| `shear_flow` | Turbulent shear | — | CFD, offshore wake models |
| `MHD_64` / `MHD_256` | Magnetohydrodynamics | — | Corrosion physics, EM |
| `acoustic_scattering_*` (3 variants) | Acoustic scattering | — | Subsea NDE, inspection |
| `helmholtz_staircase` | Acoustic / wave | — | Subsea acoustics |
| `planetswe` | Shallow water equations | — | Metocean / oceanography |
| `viscoelastic_instability` | Viscoelastic flow | — | Materials / polymer flow |
| `gray_scott_reaction_diffusion` | Reaction-diffusion | — | Corrosion, diffusion models |
| `active_matter` | Biological active fluids | low | Background / future |
| `convective_envelope_rsg` | Stellar convection | low | Background only |
| `post_neutron_star_merger` | Astrophysics | low | Background only |
| `supernova_explosion_64/128` | Astrophysics | low | Background only |
| `turbulence_gravity_cooling` | Astrophysics turbulence | medium | CFD methods crossover |
| `turbulent_radiative_layer_2D/3D` | Radiative turbulence | medium | CFD methods crossover |

## Evaluation Tasks

1. **Confirm license and terms of use** — check GitHub/Hugging Face for data license
   (CC, Apache, custom?); confirm commercial use is permitted or note restrictions
2. **Pip install and smoke test** — `pip install the_well`; verify DataLoader works via
   Hugging Face streaming (no 15 TB download required for evaluation)
3. **Score each dataset for relevance** (1–5) against current module map (WRK-383)
4. **Identify top-3 integration candidates** — datasets where the module already exists
   and The Well could provide training/validation data or benchmark baselines
5. **Assess benchmark models** — FNO and others; can they be used as baselines for any
   `digitalmodel` ML feature work?
6. **Document Hugging Face streaming pattern** — show the minimal code snippet for
   streaming a dataset without local download (useful reference for agents)
7. **Add to WRK-391 catalog** — add `the_well` entry to
   `specs/online-resources/catalog.yaml` with all required fields

## Deliverables

1. `specs/online-resources/the-well-evaluation.md` — evaluation report with dataset
   relevance scores, integration candidates, license status, and code snippet
2. Entry added to `specs/online-resources/catalog.yaml` (if that file exists from WRK-391;
   otherwise create a standalone stub)
3. Follow-on WRK candidates if top-3 integrations are identified (optionally pre-captured)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] License confirmed and documented (commercial-use status noted explicitly)
- [x] `pip install the_well` smoke test passes on ace-linux-2; result documented
- [x] All 16+ datasets scored for relevance (1–5) with one-line rationale each
- [x] Top-3 integration candidates identified with integration approach described
- [x] Hugging Face streaming code snippet validated and included in evaluation note
- [x] `specs/online-resources/the-well-evaluation.md` written and committed
- [x] WRK-391 catalog entry added or stub created
- [x] Legal scan passes on all output files

## Agentic AI Horizon

- The Well's benchmark suite (neural operator models trained on physics simulations) is
  directly applicable to the direction of ML-augmented engineering modules. Having a
  curated physics ML baseline in the ecosystem reduces the cold-start cost of any future
  ML module significantly.
- Hugging Face streaming means an agent could load a relevant dataset at plan time to
  validate a numerical method — without manual data management steps.
- If the license permits, a `worldenergydata`-style module wrapping The Well API would
  give all agents in the ecosystem access to physics simulation ground truth for validation.
