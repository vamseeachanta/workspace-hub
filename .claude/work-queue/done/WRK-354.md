# Structural module — implement jacket and topside analysis

## What

Create a jacket/topside structural analysis module following API RP 2A (WSD/LRFD) and
ISO 19902. Member capacity checks (axial, bending, combined), joint classification, and
punching shear. Wire into existing digitalmodel module framework.

## Why

Jacket structures are the most common fixed offshore platform type in the Gulf of Mexico and
globally. A structural analysis module covering member checks and joint design per industry
codes enables rapid screening and verification of platform assessments. This fills a major gap
in digitalmodel's structural engineering capability.

## Standards

- API RP 2A (WSD and LRFD)
- ISO 19902

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Member capacity checks: axial compression (column buckling), axial tension, bending,
      combined axial + bending (interaction equations)
- [x] Joint classification: K, T/Y, X per API RP 2A Section 4
- [x] Punching shear checks for tubular joints
- [ ] Config-driven input: member geometry, material, load cases (YAML/ASCII)
- [x] Pytest coverage with hand-calc verification for each check type (51 tests, all pass)
- [x] Module registered in digitalmodel's module framework
