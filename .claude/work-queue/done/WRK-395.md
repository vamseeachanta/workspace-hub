# WRK-395: Clean orphaned tests/agent_os/ in worldenergydata

**Status**: pending
**Complexity**: simple
**Computer**: ace-linux-1
**Phase**: 1 (Phase A - Quick Win)
**Related**: WRK-344 (agent_os src deleted)

## Problem
`worldenergydata/tests/agent_os/` is orphaned — the src package was archived in WRK-344
but tests/ was never cleaned up. Only `__pycache__` remains inside.

## Tasks
1. `rm -rf worldenergydata/tests/agent_os/`
2. Confirm no import references to `agent_os` remain in tests/
3. Commit in worldenergydata submodule

## Acceptance Criteria
- `tests/agent_os/` does not exist
- No `import.*agent_os` in remaining test files
- Tests pass (no collection errors from orphaned dir)
