# Pipeline and flexibles module — pressure containment checks

## What

Implement pressure containment checks per DNV-ST-F101 (pipeline) and API RP 1111 (deepwater).
System pressure test, MAOP validation, collapse checks, propagating buckle design. Subsea
pipeline wall thickness sizing workflow.

## Why

Pipeline pressure containment is one of the most fundamental subsea engineering calculations.
Having DNV-ST-F101 and API RP 1111 checks in digitalmodel enables wall thickness sizing from
first principles, which feeds directly into pipeline design and installation analysis workflows.

## Standards

- DNV-ST-F101
- API RP 1111

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] DNV-ST-F101: burst (pressure containment), collapse, combined loading, propagating buckle
- [x] API RP 1111: internal pressure design, external pressure (collapse), combined loading
- [x] System pressure test calculation per both codes
- [x] Wall thickness sizing workflow: given pressure, depth, material — output minimum WT
- [x] Config-driven input (YAML/ASCII) with material library (X52, X60, X65, X70)
- [x] Pytest coverage with published example verifications (116 tests, all passing)
