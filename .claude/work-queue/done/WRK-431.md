# feat(calculations): implement os-f101[1]

## Standard
- **ID**: os-f101[1]
- **Title**: os f101[1]
- **Org**: Unknown
- **Document**: `` (SHA: `e0cbf630f9836c26...`)
- **Summary**: 0000 O&G Oil and Gas Codes os-f101[1].pdf
- **Discipline**: pipeline

## Target Module
- **Repo**: assetutilities
- **Module**: `calculations`
- **Current status**: gap (no implementation found)
- **Capability tier target**: Tier 1 (deterministic calculation)

## What to Implement
0000 O&G Oil and Gas Codes os-f101[1].pdf

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Function implements os-f101[1] calculation
- [x] Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases
- [x] Result validated against worked example in standard (if available)
- [x] Module registry updated: status → implemented

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Standards implementation is direct engineering value: agents can invoke
  os-f101[1] calculations in automated workflows
- **Disposition: invest now** — engineering standards code is foundational
  and non-perishable
