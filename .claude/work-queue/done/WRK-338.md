# LNG tank structural checks — API 620 and EN 14620 thin-shell hoop stress

## What

Implement LNG flat-bottom storage tank structural checks per API 620 and EN 14620. Thin-shell
hoop stress, bottom plate design, wind and seismic loading. Input: tank dimensions, product
density, operating temperature. ASCII-first config.

## Why

LNG storage tank design is a core competency for acma-projects. API 620 (Appendix Q for
cryogenic service) and EN 14620 are the two primary design codes. Automating structural
checks enables rapid tank sizing and verification, supporting bid and proposal work.

## Standards

- API 620
- EN 14620

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Thin-shell hoop stress calculation: hydrostatic + gas pressure loading
- [ ] Shell course thickness sizing per API 620 (variable design point method)
- [ ] Bottom plate design: annular plate and sketch plate sizing
- [ ] Wind loading: overturning moment and shell buckling check
- [ ] Seismic loading: impulsive and convective modes per API 620 Appendix L
- [ ] Cryogenic considerations: material selection temperature limits (API 620 Appendix Q)
- [ ] ASCII-first config: tank geometry, product, environmental loads
- [ ] Pytest coverage with hand-calc verification points
