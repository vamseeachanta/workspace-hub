# data(vessel_fleet): Populate Curated Drilling Riser + Rig Fleet Datasets — DONE

## Completed

All acceptance criteria met (commit a77a24a):

- [x] `drilling_riser_components.csv` expanded 23→38 rows:
  - NOV Merlin 21" and 18.75" riser joints (bare + buoyed)
  - Cameron DDR 21" and 18.75" riser joints (bare + buoyed)
  - Hydril DHT 21" riser joint
  - S135-grade heavy-wall 21" variant
  - 21.5" and 24" OD standard sizes added
  - 30ft pup joint added

- [x] `drilling_rigs.csv` created — 2,210 offshore rigs from rig_fleet_full.bin
  (134 drillships, 309 semisubs, 1,009 jack-ups — BSEE WAR database)

- [x] `construction_vessels.csv` expanded 10→17 vessels:
  - Subsea 7: Seven Borealis, Seven Vega, Seven Arctic
  - McDermott: Amazon, DLV 2000
  - TechnipFMC: North Ocean 105, Deep Energy
  - Parquet regenerated

- [x] `DrillingRiserLoader().query(component_type="riser_joint")` returns non-empty df
  — added `query()` method with multi-criteria filtering

- [x] `filter_by_size()` now uses ±0.1" tolerance for OrcaFlex floating-point OD match

- [x] `component_id` added to enrich-and-clean.py public_match — each enriched
  fixture links back to its row in drilling_riser_components.csv

- [x] 33 tests pass
