# WRK-414: File placement validation script

**Status**: pending
**Complexity**: medium
**Computer**: ace-linux-1
**Phase**: 2 (Phase C - Skill Hardening)

## Problem
No automated enforcement of file placement rules. Issues identified manually.

## Tasks
1. Create `scripts/operations/validate-file-placement.sh`
2. Checks:
   - Generated artifacts in tests/output (FAIL)
   - tests/ inside src/ (FAIL)
   - WRK files in docs/ (WARN)
   - results/ not in .gitignore (WARN)
   - kebab-case in src/ Python tree (WARN)
3. Exit 0 = pass, 1 = fail (for CI integration)
4. Wire into pre-commit hook (optional, warn-only initially)
5. Commit at hub level

## Acceptance Criteria
- Script exists and is executable
- All checks implemented
- Script self-tests pass on a clean repo
