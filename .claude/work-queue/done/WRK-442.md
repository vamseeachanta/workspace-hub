# feat(calculations): implement Huse, E., Experimental Investigation ...

## Standard
- **ID**: Huse, E., Experimental Investigation of Deep Sea Riser Intera
- **Title**: Huse, E., Experimental Investigation of Deep Sea Riser Intera
- **Org**: Unknown
- **Document**: `` (SHA: `f86f92a5e3413dfe...`)
- **Summary**: Papers Offshore Technology Conference Huse, E., Experimental Investigation of Deep Sea Riser Intera.pdf
- **Discipline**: pipeline

## Target Module
