# Remove agent_os from assetutilities

## What
Delete `assetutilities/src/assetutilities/agent_os/` module and all related files.
`agent_os` was part of the old claude-flow/ruv-swarm era and has been superseded by
the workspace-hub `.claude/` skill/hook architecture. No external consumer imports it.

## Why
Tier-1 consistency review (2026-02-23) identified `agent_os` as an orchestration system
embedded inside a utility library — wrong layer of abstraction. All agent orchestration
now lives in workspace-hub `.claude/skills/` and `scripts/agents/`.

## Scope
- Delete `assetutilities/src/assetutilities/agent_os/` (5 Python files)
- Delete `assetutilities/src/assetutilities/cli/create-module-agent.py` (depends on agent_os)
- Delete `assetutilities/tests/agent_os/` (agent_os tests)
- Delete `assetutilities/tests/modules/agent_os/` (integration tests)
- Clean up Part 3 (Agent OS) from `assetutilities/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `assetutilities/src/assetutilities/agent_os/` deleted
- [ ] `assetutilities/src/assetutilities/cli/create-module-agent.py` deleted
- [ ] Agent_os tests deleted
- [ ] No remaining imports of `agent_os` in assetutilities
- [ ] `assetutilities` test suite passes after deletion
- [ ] `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Part 3 agent-os references removed

## Notes
- No external repos import from `assetutilities.agent_os` (confirmed via grep)
- `create-module-agent.py` has a path-hack `sys.path.insert` to agent_os — delete with it
