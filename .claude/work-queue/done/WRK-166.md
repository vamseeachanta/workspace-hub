# Jabra USB Dongle Lost — Universal Dongle Compatibility

## What
Jabra USB dongle has been lost. Research whether a universal Bluetooth dongle can replace the original Jabra dongle for the headset.

## Why
- Need to restore headset functionality without purchasing an exact OEM replacement
- Universal dongles are cheaper and more readily available

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify Jabra headset model
- [ ] Research if Jabra headsets work with generic Bluetooth USB dongles
- [ ] If Jabra-specific: find replacement dongle options and pricing
- [ ] If universal works: recommend a compatible universal dongle
- [ ] Document any pairing steps required

## Plan
- **Step 1**: Identify the exact Jabra headset model (check device, packaging, or settings)
- **Step 2**: Check Jabra support docs — some models (Evolve2, Engage) require the proprietary Jabra Link dongle; others (Elite, Talk) use standard Bluetooth
- **Step 3**: If proprietary required: Jabra Link 380/390 available separately (~$30-50). If standard BT: any USB BT 5.0 dongle works
- **Step 4**: Document findings

## Research Findings

### Key Finding: Generic Dongles Do NOT Fully Replace Jabra-Proprietary Dongles

For Jabra wireless headsets in the **Evolve**, **Evolve2**, **Engage**, and **Speak** series, a
generic Bluetooth USB dongle will provide **audio only** — it will not enable call control
(answer/end calls, mute, volume) through the softphone. Full integration requires a Jabra Link
adapter. Jabra headsets in the **Elite** and **Talk** consumer series use standard Bluetooth and
work with any USB BT dongle.

### Compatible Dongle Models (Jabra-Proprietary)

Two current replacement dongles are sold separately. Match the dongle to your headset generation:

| Dongle | Part Number | Connector | Bluetooth | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jabra Link 370 UC | 14208-07 | USB-A | BT 4.2 | Evolve 65/65e/65t/75/75e, Speak 510/710 |
| Jabra Link 370 MS | 14208-08 | USB-A | BT 4.2 | Same + Microsoft Teams / Skype for Business |
| Jabra Link 380a UC | 14208-26 | USB-A | BT 5.0 | Evolve2 65/75/85, Evolve 65/65e/75, Speak 710 |
| Jabra Link 380a MS | 14208-24 | USB-A | BT 5.0 | Same + Microsoft Teams certified |
| Jabra Link 380c UC | 14208-25 | USB-C | BT 5.0 | Same as 380a UC, USB-C port |
| Jabra Link 380c MS | 14208-22 | USB-C | BT 5.0 | Same as 380a MS, USB-C port |

**Rule of thumb:**
- Evolve (original) series → Link 370
- Evolve2 series → Link 380
- Either dongle can technically pair with either generation, but the Link 380 is recommended for
  Evolve2 devices to get the full BT 5.0 benefit and firmware update support via Jabra Direct.
- **UC** = works with any UC softphone (Zoom, Webex, generic SIP). **MS** = adds Teams button
  integration; both are otherwise equivalent.

### Pairing Process

Replacing a lost dongle requires re-pairing because the original dongle was pre-paired at the
factory. Steps via Jabra Direct (recommended):

1. Install **Jabra Direct** (free) from jabra.com — Windows and macOS only.
2. Plug in the new Link 370 or Link 380 dongle.
3. Open Jabra Direct → select the dongle → click **Pairing**.
4. Put the headset into Bluetooth pairing mode (hold the Bluetooth button on the headset until
   the LED flashes rapidly — exact button varies by model; check the headset quick-start guide).
5. In Jabra Direct, click **Search** under "Available Bluetooth Devices", then select your headset.
6. Pairing completes in a few seconds; LED on dongle goes solid.

**Without Jabra Direct (manual hardware pairing):**
1. With the dongle already plugged in and the headset powered on, hold the pairing button on the
   dongle (small button on the side) for 3–5 seconds until it flashes.
2. Put the headset in pairing mode simultaneously.
3. Both LEDs go solid once paired.
4. Note: this method works for audio but does not enable over-the-air firmware updates.

The Link 380 dongle remembers up to **8 paired devices** but connects to only **1 at a time**.
You can connect the headset to two paired adapters simultaneously (e.g., dongle + phone) if the
headset supports multipoint — consult your specific headset model's documentation.

### OS Support

| OS | Link 370 | Link 380 |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 10 / 11 | Full support, plug-and-play, no drivers needed | Full support, plug-and-play |
| macOS 11+ | Full support, plug-and-play | Full support, plug-and-play |
| Linux | Audio works via standard HID; Jabra Direct not available, so no call-control integration or firmware updates | Same as Link 370 on Linux |
| Chrome OS | Basic audio; Jabra Direct not available | Same as Link 370 |

Jabra Direct (required for pairing UI and firmware updates) is available for **Windows and macOS
only**. On Linux the manual hardware-pairing method above is the only option.

### Where to Purchase

**New (retail):**
- Jabra official store: jabra.com/accessories/jabra-link-370 and jabra.com/accessories/jabra-link-380
- Amazon (Link 370 UC 14208-07): ~$40–55 USD
- Amazon (Link 380a MS 14208-24): ~$70 USD
- Amazon (Link 380a UC 14208-26): ~$83 USD
- Amazon (Link 380c MS 14208-22): similar to 380a, USB-C version
- Staples, CDW, Headset Experts, Lexair — business-oriented resellers with stock

**Used / Open Box (budget option):**
- eBay: genuine used Link 370 units available for $15–30; Link 380 for $25–45
- Verify the seller is selling the correct part number for your headset generation

**Approximate price summary:**
- Link 370 (older gen, BT 4.2): $40–55 new, $15–30 used
- Link 380a/c (current gen, BT 5.0): $70–85 new, $25–45 used

### Recommendation

1. **Identify your headset model first** (printed on the headset ear cup or under a battery
   cover). This determines which dongle generation to buy.
2. For **Evolve 65 / 65e / 65t / 75 / Speak 510 / Speak 710**: buy the **Link 370 UC** (14208-07)
   or **Link 370 MS** (14208-08) — cheaper and fully compatible.
3. For **Evolve2 65 / 75 / 85**: buy the **Link 380a UC** (14208-26) or **Link 380a MS**
   (14208-24) for USB-A, or the **380c** variants for USB-C.
4. **Do not rely on a generic Bluetooth dongle** if you need call control (answer/end calls from
   the headset button). Generic dongles provide audio streaming only.
5. If cost is the main concern, a used Link 370 from eBay (~$15–20) restores full functionality
   for the older Evolve series at minimal cost.

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Hardware research (Jabra dongle compatibility) is a personal procurement task with no ecosystem agentic value.
- Web research and product comparison agents handle this type of task well already.
- **Disposition: do now** — trivial task; execute immediately or with a web-search agent; no reason to defer.
