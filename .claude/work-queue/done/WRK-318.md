# Production forecasting module — Arps decline curve

## What

Implement Arps decline curve analysis (exponential, hyperbolic, harmonic) for oil/gas well
production forecasting. Fit to historical BSEE production data, project EUR, generate forecast
curves. Add CLI: `worldenergydata forecast --api WellID`.

## Why

Decline curve analysis is the industry-standard method for production forecasting and reserves
estimation. Integrating Arps DCA with worldenergydata's existing BSEE production data creates
an end-to-end workflow from historical data to EUR projection without leaving the toolset.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Arps decline models: exponential (b=0), hyperbolic (0<b<2), harmonic (b=1)
- [x] Curve fitting via least-squares regression (scipy.optimize.curve_fit)
- [x] EUR (Estimated Ultimate Recovery) calculation with economic limit input
- [x] Forecast curve generation (confidence interval fields reserved in dataclass)
- [x] CLI interface: `worldenergydata forecast --model hyperbolic --months 120`
- [x] Re-exported from `worldenergydata.production` (alongside UnifiedProductionClient)
- [x] 12 pytest unit tests with synthetic decline data — all pass
