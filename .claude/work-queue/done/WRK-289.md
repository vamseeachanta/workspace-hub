# Research open source FEA programs for engineering assignments

## What

Conduct a thorough research survey of open source Finite Element Analysis (FEA) programs
available for Linux. Evaluate each for suitability in engineering assignments — structural,
thermal, and multiphysics analysis. Produce a recommendation report with installation notes.

## Why

Before installing FEA tools on ace-linux-2, we need to know which programs are actively
maintained, well-documented, and practical for real engineering coursework/assignments. Bad
tool choices waste setup time and create workflow dead-ends.

## Research Scope

### Programs to Evaluate
| Program | Domain | Notes |
|---------|--------|
-------|
| **CalculiX** | Structural FEA | Abaqus-compatible input format |
| **Code_Aster** / **Salome-Meca** | Structural, thermal | French nuclear industry heritage |
| **Elmer FEM** | Multiphysics | CSC Finland, wide physics coverage |
| **MOOSE Framework** | Multiphysics FEA | Idaho National Lab, modular |
| **GetDP** | General FE solver | Gmsh ecosystem |
| **PrePoMax** | Pre/post for CalculiX | GUI, may need Wine on Linux |
| **FEniCS / FEniCSx** | PDE-based FEA | Python-driven, academic favorite |
| **deal.II** | Adaptive FEM | C++ library, high-order elements |
| **SU2** | Multiphysics / CFD-adjacent | Stanford, aero-focused |
| Any others discovered | — | Cast wide net during research |

### Evaluation Criteria
For each program, assess:
1. **Active maintenance** — last release date, commit frequency, community size
2. **Linux support** — native packages (apt/snap/flatpak) vs build-from-source
3. **Documentation quality** — tutorials, examples, assignment-ready material
4. **Learning curve** — time to first useful result
5. **File format support** — STEP, STL, Gmsh mesh, VTK for post-processing
6. **Integration** — works with FreeCAD, Gmsh, ParaView, OpenFOAM
7. **Assignment suitability** — can solve beam bending, heat transfer, modal analysis, etc.
8. **Python scripting** — automation and parametric study capability

### Deliverable
A markdown report at `docs/research/open-source-fea-survey.md` containing:
- Comparison matrix (all programs × all criteria)
- Top 3 recommendations with rationale
- Installation instructions for recommended programs
- Example assignment workflows (e.g., "cantilever beam analysis in CalculiX")

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 8 FEA programs evaluated against all criteria
- [ ] Comparison matrix completed
- [ ] Top 3 recommendations identified with clear rationale
- [ ] Installation notes for each recommendation (Linux/Ubuntu)
- [ ] At least 2 example assignment workflows described
- [ ] Report written to `docs/research/open-source-fea-survey.md`

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Pure research task — ideal for AI-assisted survey and comparison
- Web search needed for latest release dates and community activity
- Results feed directly into WRK-291 (install selected FEA programs)
