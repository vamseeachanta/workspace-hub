# WRK-405: Resolve digitalmodel dual test root (tests/ vs tests/unit/)

**Status**: pending
**Complexity**: medium
**Computer**: ace-linux-1
**Phase**: 3 (Phase B - Medium Refactor)
**Related**: WRK-377 (added tests/unit/well/)

## Problem
WRK-377 introduced `tests/unit/well/` but 95% of modules use `tests/<domain>/`.
Decision: adopt `tests/<domain>/` as canonical.

## Tasks
1. Move `tests/unit/well/` → `tests/well/` (or `tests/domains/well/`)
2. Remove `tests/unit/` dir
3. Update pytest paths if needed
4. Run tests to verify
5. Commit in digitalmodel submodule

## Acceptance Criteria
- No `tests/unit/` directory
- `tests/well/` contains the moved tests
- All tests collect and pass
