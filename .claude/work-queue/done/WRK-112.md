# Appliance Lifecycle Analytics Module for assethold

## What
Add an appliance lifecycle analysis capability to assethold that tracks and analyzes household/commercial appliances over their full lifecycle. The module should aggregate manufacturer data, maintenance history, repair ratings, and reliability scores sourced from online research. It should also provide geographic analysis of vendor-preferred appliance companies — answering how many preferred vendors exist in a given geographic area.

## Why
Property asset management requires understanding appliance health, replacement timing, and vendor availability. Tracking lifecycle data (manufacturer reliability, maintenance frequency, repair costs, vendor density) enables better capital planning, warranty tracking, and vendor selection for property portfolios.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] New module at `assethold/src/assethold/modules/appliances/` (or similar)
- [x] Appliance data model covering: manufacturer, model, install date, expected lifespan, maintenance schedule, repair history, reliability rating
- [ ] Online research integration (web scraping or API) for manufacturer data, Consumer Reports-style ratings, and repair statistics — boundary method `_fetch_vendor_data` defined and mockable; live provider integration deferred (parked per Agentic AI Horizon note)
- [x] Geographic vendor analysis: given a location, determine how many vendor-preferred appliance service companies operate in the area
- [x] Lifecycle cost calculator: estimate total cost of ownership over appliance lifespan
- [x] Data storage strategy (YAML/JSON/DB) for appliance inventory and vendor data — JSON round-trip implemented
- [x] Unit tests for data models, lifecycle calculations, and vendor lookup — 77 tests, all passing
- [x] CLI or config-driven interface for querying appliance status and vendor counts

*Source: add to assethold an ability to analyze appliance data over its life cycle. Manufacturer data, maintenance, repair rating etc. are to be tracked based on online research. how many vendor preferred appliance companies are there in a geographic area*

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Appliance lifecycle analytics in assethold expands personal asset tracking to physical household assets — moderate personal value, limited ecosystem agentic boost.
- Appliance monitoring and lifecycle prediction will increasingly be available via IoT platform integrations in 3–4 months rather than custom code.
- **Disposition: park 2-3 months** — personal asset management task; revisit when smarter home automation agents exist; low urgency relative to engineering and infrastructure work.
