# review(workflow): Apply Claude Review-Mode Policy to WRK-624 Final Review

## Problem

`WRK-650` codified the validated Claude review policy:
- full bundle for higher-quality, full-context review
- compact bundle for faster screening

The next step is to apply that policy explicitly to `WRK-624` and capture a
policy-compliant final Claude review artifact.

## What

Use the now-documented mode-selection policy to run the appropriate Claude review
for `WRK-624`, record the artifact, and summarize the result.

## Scope

1. select the correct Claude review mode for `WRK-624` under the new policy
2. run Claude review and capture the artifact
3. summarize the resulting findings
4. produce HTML review artifact for user inspection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Claude review mode is selected explicitly under the new policy
- [x] Final Claude review artifact is captured for `WRK-624`
- [x] Result summary is documented
- [x] HTML review artifact exists for user inspection

## Evidence

- Final Claude artifact: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-651/claude-review-final.md`
- Results: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-651/results.md`
- HTML review artifact: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-651/review.html`

## Outcome

Applying the documented policy from `WRK-650`, the correct final Claude review mode
for `WRK-624` is full bundle. The validated full-bundle review from `WRK-649` is
therefore the final policy-compliant Claude review artifact for this item.
