# Install smartmontools on ace-linux-1 + SMART health check

## What

Install smartmontools on ace-linux-1 and run SMART diagnostics on all 3 drives. Update
the aceengineer-01.md assessment file with results.

## Why

- aceengineer-01.md lists "SMART: Unavailable (smartmontools not installed)" for all 3 drives
- The 8 TB Seagate and 1 TB WDC are both used drives with unknown health
- The 250 GB Crucial SSD is an older model — wear level unknown
- WRK-293 (ace-linux-2 SMART check) found 140 reallocated sectors on a similar WDC drive —
  ace-linux-1 has the same model family and may have similar degradation

## Steps

1. `sudo apt install -y smartmontools` (on ace-linux-1)
2. Run SMART checks:
   - `sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda` (7.3 TB Seagate ST8000DM004)
   - `sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb` (233 GB Crucial CT250BX100SSD1)
   - `sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdc` (932 GB WDC WD10EZEX-00BN5A0)
3. Extract key metrics: power-on hours, reallocated sectors, pending sectors, temperature
4. Update `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-01.md`:
   - Add SMART Health sub-table (matching aceengineer-02.md format)
   - Update Storage table SMART column
   - Update Platform Analysis with findings
5. Check aceengineer-01.md pending actions and mark SMART items done

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] smartmontools installed on ace-linux-1
- [ ] SMART data collected for all 3 drives
- [ ] aceengineer-01.md updated with SMART results
- [ ] Any failing/warning drives flagged
