# Consolidate weekly usage work items and record canonical ownership

## What
Review the overlapping weekly agent-usage work items, decide which item is the canonical archived implementation record and which item remains the canonical open follow-up, then add cross-references and supersession notes so future weekly-usage runs map to the correct WRK id.

## Why
`WRK-108`, `WRK-172`, and `WRK-207` currently overlap in scope. That makes it easy to execute the weekly usage script under the wrong item and weakens queue clarity for future sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `WRK-108`, `WRK-172`, and `WRK-207` reviewed against current `query-quota.sh` behavior
- [ ] Canonical archived implementation item identified and justified
- [ ] Canonical open follow-up item identified and justified
- [ ] Supersession / relevance notes added to the affected WRK items
- [ ] Any obsolete overlap is explicitly documented rather than left implicit
- [ ] `INDEX.md` regenerated after edits

## Plan
1. Compare `WRK-108`, `WRK-172`, and `WRK-207` to current `scripts/ai/assessment/query-quota.sh` behavior and classify each item as baseline implementation, broader infrastructure, or remaining defect follow-up.
2. Choose the canonical archived implementation record and the canonical active follow-up for weekly usage in the repo ecosystem.
3. Update the affected WRK files with concise notes:
   - `WRK-108`: superseded or historical-origin note
   - `WRK-172`: canonical archived implementation note if confirmed
   - `WRK-207`: canonical open bug/follow-up note if confirmed
4. Regenerate `INDEX.md` and summarize the resulting ownership model for future weekly-usage runs.
