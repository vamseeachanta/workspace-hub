# The Well — shear_flow Dataset for Hydrodynamics ML Baseline

## What

Integrate The Well's `shear_flow` (turbulent shear flow simulation) dataset as a machine
learning baseline benchmark for `digitalmodel/hydrodynamics/` modules. The dataset
provides ground-truth turbulent flow fields suitable for training neural operator surrogate
models.

The Well package: `pip install the_well` (v1.2.0, CC BY 4.0)
Dataset: `shear_flow` — 2D turbulent shear flow, DNS-quality velocity/vorticity fields

## Why

WRK-393 rated shear_flow 4/5 relevance for hydrodynamics ML. Turbulent shear flow is
central to offshore wake modelling, drag estimation, and CFD validation. Having benchmark
ML baselines (FNO models from The Well) means:
- Agents can compare custom ML models against published baselines on the same data
- Neural operator training can start immediately (pre-existing benchmark architecture)
- WRK-380 (Gmsh→OpenFOAM→OrcaFlex) pipeline can be validated against shear_flow ground truth

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `the_well` added to digitalmodel optional deps (`[well]` extra)
- [x] `digitalmodel/hydrodynamics/well_datasets/shear_flow_loader.py` created
- [x] `ShearFlowLoader.stream_sample(n_steps=10)` returns velocity/vorticity snapshots
- [x] Integration test: smoke-test streaming, no full download (28 tests pass, all mocked)
- [x] FNO benchmark model entry documented in shear_flow_loader.py docstring and example
- [x] Attribution: CC BY 4.0 in all files
- [x] Tests pass in digitalmodel pytest suite (28/28)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Shear flow ML baseline is a stepping stone to surrogate modelling (H2 in VISION.md)
- Pre-trained FNO weights + The Well data = instant benchmark for any new hydrodynamics model
- **Disposition: invest now** — direct path to ML-augmented hydrodynamics; no data collection needed
