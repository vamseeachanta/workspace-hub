# SMART health check on ace-linux-2 drives

## What

Install smartmontools on ace-linux-2 and run SMART diagnostics on all 3 drives. Document
results in the aceengineer-02.md assessment file.

## Why

Three drives are in service with no health monitoring. The 2.7 TB Seagate (ST3000NC002) and
931 GB WDC are used drives with unknown hours. SMART data reveals pending failures before
data loss. This is a WRK-050 Phase 2 prerequisite.

## Steps

1. `sudo apt install -y smartmontools`
2. `sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda` (931 GB WDC WD10EZEX)
3. `sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb` (465 GB Samsung 870 EVO)
4. `sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdc` (2.7 TB Seagate ST3000NC002)
5. Record key metrics: power-on hours, reallocated sectors, pending sectors, temperature
6. Update `specs/modules/hardware-inventory/aceengineer-02.md` SMART column
7. Flag any drives with concerning health for replacement planning

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] smartmontools installed on ace-linux-2
- [ ] SMART data collected for all 3 drives
- [ ] aceengineer-02.md updated with SMART results
- [ ] Any failing/warning drives flagged in WRK-050
