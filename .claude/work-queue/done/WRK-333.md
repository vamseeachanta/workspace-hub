# Establish OGManufacturing repo structure — README src specs tests scaffold

## What

OGManufacturing currently has minimal structure. Add: README.md describing mission,
src/ogmanufacturing/ package with __init__.py, specs/ directory, tests/ with conftest.py,
pyproject.toml, .pre-commit-config.yaml. Pattern after digitalmodel structure.

## Why

A well-structured repo is the foundation for all subsequent development. Without a standard
layout (src, specs, tests, pyproject.toml), adding modules becomes ad-hoc and inconsistent.
Patterning after digitalmodel ensures OGManufacturing follows the same conventions used across
the workspace, enabling AI agents to work with it effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] README.md: repo mission (oil and gas manufacturing/production engineering)
- [x] src/ogmanufacturing/__init__.py with version string
- [x] specs/ directory with placeholder README
- [x] tests/ directory with conftest.py
- [x] pyproject.toml: project metadata, dependencies, pytest config
- [x] .pre-commit-config.yaml: legal scan hook (pattern from digitalmodel)
- [x] `uv run python -c "import ogmanufacturing"` succeeds
- [x] `uv run python -m pytest tests/` succeeds (empty but functional)
