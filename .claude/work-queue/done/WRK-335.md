# Drilling engineering module — casing design checks per API TR 5C3

## What

Implement casing design checks per API TR 5C3: burst (internal pressure), collapse (external
pressure), axial tension (body and connection). ASCII-first config: wellbore geometry, mud
weights, formation pressures. Output: design factor table per casing string.

## Why

Casing design is fundamental to well construction. API TR 5C3 provides the performance
properties and design equations for OCTG (Oil Country Tubular Goods). Automating burst,
collapse, and tension checks with proper design factors enables rapid casing string selection
and verification for well design.

## Standards

- API TR 5C3

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Burst check: internal pressure rating per API TR 5C3 (Barlow formula with de-rating)
- [x] Collapse check: yield, plastic, transition, and elastic collapse regimes
- [x] Axial tension check: body yield and connection rating
- [x] Biaxial correction: collapse under axial tension (ellipse of plasticity)
- [x] Load case generation: kick, lost circulation, cementing, production
- [x] Design factor table output: burst DF, collapse DF, tension DF per depth
- [x] Pytest coverage with API TR 5C3 published performance property verification (55 tests, all pass)
