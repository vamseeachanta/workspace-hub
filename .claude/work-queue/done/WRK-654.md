# chore(workflow): Summarize Recent Review/Debug Chain for WRK-624

## Problem

The recent WRK-624 review/debug sequence produced useful outcomes, but the history is
spread across multiple WRKs. A short summary note would make the chain easier to
understand without reading every item individually.

## What

Add a concise summary note linking the main review/debug WRKs and their outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Summary note exists on the main WRK or a linked artifact
- [x] Main follow-on WRKs and outcomes are listed succinctly
- [x] Queue state remains valid

## Evidence

- Updated WRK item: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/done/WRK-624.md`

## Outcome

`WRK-624` now contains a concise review/debug chain summary so the recent sequence
of follow-on work items and their outcomes can be understood from the parent item
without opening each WRK individually.
