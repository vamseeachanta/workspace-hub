# feat(calculations): implement Smith, C.S., et al, 1981 - Residual S...

## Standard
- **ID**: Smith, C.S., et al, 1981 - Residual Strength and Stiffness 
- **Title**: Smith, C.S., et al, 1981   Residual Strength and Stiffness
- **Org**: Unknown
- **Document**: `` (SHA: `57dcfb9793e921dc...`)
- **Summary**: Papers Offshore Technology Conference Smith, C.S., et al, 1981 - Residual Strength and Stiffness .pdf
- **Discipline**: marine

## Target Module
- **Repo**: assetutilities
- **Module**: `calculations`
- **Current status**: gap (no implementation found)
- **Capability tier target**: Tier 1 (deterministic calculation)

## What to Implement
Papers Offshore Technology Conference Smith, C.S., et al, 1981 - Residual Strength and Stiffness .pdf

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Function implements Smith, C.S., et al, 1981 - Residual S... calculation
- [ ] Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases
- [ ] Result validated against worked example in standard (if available)
- [ ] Module registry updated: status → implemented

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Standards implementation is direct engineering value: agents can invoke
  Smith, C.S., et al, 1981 - Residual S... calculations in automated workflows
- **Disposition: invest now** — engineering standards code is foundational
  and non-perishable
