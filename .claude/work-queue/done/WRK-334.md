# Production surveillance module — well KPI tracking GOR WCT PI

## What

Build a production surveillance module tracking key well KPIs: Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR), Water Cut
(WCT), Productivity Index (PI), pressure drawdown. CSV input, time-series output, anomaly
flagging (sudden GOR increase = potential gas breakthrough). Wire to BSEE data
(worldenergydata).

## Why

Production surveillance is the core activity of production engineering. Tracking GOR, WCT,
and PI trends enables early detection of production problems (water coning, gas breakthrough,
formation damage). Automated anomaly flagging replaces manual spreadsheet monitoring with
systematic, reproducible surveillance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CSV input parser for production data (date, oil rate, gas rate, water rate, pressures)
- [x] GOR calculation and trend tracking
- [x] WCT (water cut) calculation and trend tracking
- [x] Productivity Index calculation from rate and pressure drawdown
- [x] Anomaly detection: flag sudden changes in GOR, WCT, PI (configurable thresholds)
- [x] Time-series output: KPI DataFrame with alert columns
- [ ] Integration with worldenergydata BSEE production data as input source (deferred)
- [x] Pytest coverage with synthetic well production data (40 tests, 100% branch coverage)
