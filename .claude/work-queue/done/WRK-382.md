# Marketing Follow-up — Brochure and Portfolio Sync for WRK-373/375

## What

Two completion hooks fired with `brochure_status: pending` after archiving WRK-373
(ecosystem vision) and WRK-375 (Drillbotics strategy). This item clears both:

**WRK-373 outputs to market:**
- The autonomous-production vision framework (6-level ladder, Sense-Plan-Act loop,
  3-horizon roadmap) as a differentiator in how ACE Engineering approaches projects

**WRK-375 outputs to market:**
- Drilling automation domain depth: Drillbotics Mode V capability map, ROP/hydraulics/
  T&D roadmap, SPE community engagement positioning

**Deliverables:**
1. Update `digitalmodel/docs/marketing/` — add a section or new brochure covering
   drilling automation capabilities and the H1 roadmap (ROP model, hydraulics, dysfunction
   detection)
2. Update `aceengineer-website/docs/marketing/PORTFOLIO_CAPABILITIES.md` — add:
   - Autonomous production engineering vision (from WRK-373)
   - Drilling automation capability roadmap and Drillbotics engagement (from WRK-375)

## Why

The completion hook system exists to ensure technical work translates into visible
capability marketing. Both WRK-373 and WRK-375 produced strategic outputs that
differentiate ACE Engineering — leaving them unmarked in the portfolio misses the
marketing value of the work already done.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `digitalmodel/docs/marketing/` updated with drilling automation capability section
- [ ] `aceengineer-website/docs/marketing/PORTFOLIO_CAPABILITIES.md` updated with
  autonomous-production vision summary (3–5 bullet points) and drilling automation roadmap
- [ ] WRK-373 archived item `brochure_status` updated to `synced`
- [ ] WRK-375 archived item `brochure_status` updated to `synced`

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Not applicable — routine marketing maintenance
