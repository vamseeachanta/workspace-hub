# Rename aceengineer-website/src/ to content/

## What
Rename `aceengineer-website/src/` to `aceengineer-website/content/` and update all
build references. The directory contains HTML/content files, not Python source — the
`src/` name misleads anyone reading the ecosystem.

## Why
Tier-1 consistency review (2026-02-23): `src/` in all other repos = Python source.
In aceengineer-website it contains HTML, blog posts, and calculators. Renaming to
`content/` aligns name with purpose and eliminates confusion.

## Scope
- `git mv src/ content/` in aceengineer-website
- Update `build.js`: `const srcDir = './src'` → `const srcDir = './content'`
- Update `posthtml.config.js`: `root: './src'` → `root: './content'`
- Verify `npm run build` produces correct output

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `aceengineer-website/content/` exists with all original HTML content
- [ ] `aceengineer-website/src/` no longer exists
- [ ] `build.js` references `./content`
- [ ] `posthtml.config.js` references `./content`
- [ ] `npm run build` completes without errors

## Notes
- `vercel.json` uses `outputDirectory: "dist"` — no change needed
- Vercel deploy is unaffected (input dir change is build-time only)
