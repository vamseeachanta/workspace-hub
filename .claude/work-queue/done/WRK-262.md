## Summary

Session bootstrap analysis (WRK-232) detected a recurring path-handling knowledge gap:
users have explicitly corrected the agent 2+ times with "use relative file paths" and
"do not use stale hardcoded path". The correction pattern also dominates the
`.claude/state/corrections/` data.

## Proposed Fix

Add a brief path-discipline reminder to `.claude/skills/coordination/workspace/session-analysis/SKILL.md`
(or the session-start preflight sequence) so the agent is reminded at session start:
- Prefer relative paths inside repo-scoped scripts
- Never hardcode `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/` in generated scripts (use env var or `$(pwd)`)
- Use absolute paths only when explicitly required (e.g. file_path in tool calls to tools that require absolute paths)

## Evidence

- 2 explicit user corrections in session history
- "path-handling" is the largest single category in correction gap analysis
- Patterns file (2026-02-06): correction rate elevated across 273 sessions

## Done When

- [x] Preflight reminder added to session-analysis or session-start skill
- [x] Entry added to `.claude/rules/` or CLAUDE.md quick-reference if appropriate
