# CALM buoy mooring fatigue — spectral fatigue from OrcaFlex time-domain output

## What

Automate spectral fatigue analysis for CALM buoy mooring chains and hawsers from OrcaFlex
time-domain output. Rainflow counting, S-N curve application, accumulated damage, and
inspection interval recommendation. Per DNVGL-RP-C205 and API RP 2SK.

## Why

Mooring fatigue is a critical limit state for CALM buoy systems. OrcaFlex produces
time-domain tension histories but fatigue post-processing is typically done manually in
spreadsheets. Automating rainflow counting and damage accumulation reduces error and enables
rapid sensitivity studies across multiple sea states and mooring configurations.

## Standards

- DNVGL-RP-C205
- API RP 2SK

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] OrcaFlex time-domain results reader (tension time histories per line/segment)
- [x] Rainflow counting implementation (ASTM E1049 or equivalent)
- [x] S-N curve application for mooring chain and wire rope (API RP 2SK curves)
- [x] Miner's rule accumulated damage calculation
- [x] Fatigue life and inspection interval output per mooring line
- [x] Scatter diagram integration: weight damage by sea-state probability
- [x] Pytest coverage with synthetic tension histories and known damage results
