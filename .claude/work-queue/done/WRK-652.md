# review(workflow): Attach Final Review Artifacts and Synthesis to WRK-624

## Problem

`WRK-624` now has a policy-selected final Claude review artifact, but the work item
itself does not yet point directly to the adopted artifact set or a final synthesis
surface.

## What

Update `WRK-624` review references and produce a final synthesis artifact covering
Claude, Codex, and Gemini outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `WRK-624` points to the adopted final Claude review artifact
- [x] Final review synthesis artifact exists
- [x] Summary of multi-agent findings is documented
- [x] HTML review artifact exists if needed for user inspection

## Evidence

- Updated WRK item: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/done/WRK-624.md`
- Review synthesis: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-652/review-synthesis.md`
- HTML review artifact: `/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-652/review.html`

## Outcome

`WRK-624` now points directly to the adopted final Claude review artifact and to a
final multi-agent synthesis surface covering Claude, Codex, and Gemini. The final
review state is explicit on the work item itself.
