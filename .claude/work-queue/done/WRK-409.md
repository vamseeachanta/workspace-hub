# WRK-409: Clarify worldenergydata eia/ vs eia_us/ split

**Status**: pending
**Complexity**: medium
**Computer**: ace-linux-1
**Phase**: 4 (Phase B - Medium Refactor)
**Evidence**: git log c149b32

## Problem
Two parallel EIA packages with unclear split:
- `eia_us/` (older) — US-only BSEE/RRC/EIA data
- `eia/` (Feb 2026) — possibly international EIA API client

## Tasks
1. Audit contents and imports of both `eia/` and `eia_us/`
2. Define clear split: eia_us/ = US-only; eia/ = international
3. If roles overlap: merge; if distinct: add docstrings clarifying scope
4. Update imports as needed
5. Commit in worldenergydata submodule

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clear documented split between eia/ and eia_us/
- No functional overlap
- Tests pass
