# feat(skills): add work-document-and-exit skill

## What

Add a skill to the workspace-hub ecosystem that:

1. Documents the current in-progress WRK item's state (what was done, what is pending, files changed, next steps)
2. Prepares a clean handoff note for resuming the work item in a future session
3. Stages files for commit (or generates the commit command) without committing
4. Exits the session cleanly

## Why

When a session ends mid-task, resuming the work item requires re-reading files and context
to reconstruct state. A dedicated skill that writes a structured handoff note to the WRK
item itself (or a companion `.session-handoff.md`) reduces re-ramp time.

This is the "prepare for exit" counterpart to `/session-start`'s context-loading step.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Skill created at `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/work-document-exit/SKILL.md`
- [x] When invoked, reads the active WRK item (from `.claude/state/active-wrk`)
- [x] Appends a `## Session Handoff — <date>` section to the WRK item file with:
      - Files changed this session (git diff --name-only)
      - What was completed (summary)
      - What remains (next steps)
      - Commit command ready to paste
- [x] Clears active-wrk state
- [x] Works even when there is no active WRK (documents general session state)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Simple, high-leverage workflow. Could be auto-triggered by `/session-end`.
- In 3-4 months, an agent might auto-infer this from session signals; for now explicit skill is faster.
