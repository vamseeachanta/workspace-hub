# feat(calculations): implement Fox, S.A., et al, 1995 - Design Analy...

## Standard
- **ID**: Fox, S.A., et al, 1995 - Design Analysis and Full Scale Pro
- **Title**: Fox, S.A., et al, 1995   Design Analysis and Full Scale Pro
- **Org**: Unknown
- **Document**: `` (SHA: `1624a42f6fb86884...`)
- **Summary**: Papers Offshore Technology Conference Fox, S.A., et al, 1995 - Design Analysis and Full Scale Pro.pdf
- **Discipline**: marine

## Target Module
- **Repo**: assetutilities
- **Module**: `calculations`
- **Current status**: gap (no implementation found)
- **Capability tier target**: Tier 1 (deterministic calculation)

## What to Implement
Papers Offshore Technology Conference Fox, S.A., et al, 1995 - Design Analysis and Full Scale Pro.pdf

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Function implements Fox, S.A., et al, 1995 - Design Analy... calculation
- [ ] Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases
- [ ] Result validated against worked example in standard (if available)
- [ ] Module registry updated: status → implemented

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Standards implementation is direct engineering value: agents can invoke
  Fox, S.A., et al, 1995 - Design Analy... calculations in automated workflows
- **Disposition: invest now** — engineering standards code is foundational
  and non-perishable
