# automation: refresh orchestrator timeline reports

## Problem

The comparison report in WRK-656 now encourages rerunning the orchestrators when WRK-624 or tooling changes, but updating the HTML, logs, and timestamps is manual. We need an automated job to replay the WRK-66x summary updates so the orchestrator timeline stays consistent without extra editing.

## What

Create a script (e.g., `scripts/workflow/refresh-orchestrator-timeline.sh`) that: copies the latest plan/review/claim artifacts from a nominated WRK-66x run, reruns `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py`, regenerates the summary HTML entry for that agent, and appends a timestamped line to `assets/WRK-656/orchestrator-timeline.md` or similar. Schedule it to run manually (per user request) whenever a rerun is needed.

## Plan

1. Script design: parameterize the WRK id, agent name, and asset folder; ensure it preserves existing log paths and updates `verify-gate-evidence` output.
2. Summary regeneration: update the relevant summary HTML (WRK-669/670/671) and the comparison HTML with the new timestamped entry for each rerun.
3. Timeline artifact: create `assets/WRK-656/orchestrator-timeline.md` to record rerun dates, extra notes, and the list of artifacts refreshed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The automation script copies artifacts/logs, reruns the validator, and updates the summary HTML for a chosen WRK-66x run.
- [ ] `assets/WRK-656/orchestrator-timeline.md` records rerun events with timestamps, agent names, and notes about what changed.
- [ ] The comparison HTML references the timeline file so readers know when reruns occurred.

## Evidence

- `scripts/workflow/refresh-orchestrator-timeline.sh`
- `assets/WRK-656/orchestrator-timeline.md`
- Updated summary HTML(s) and validator output for the rerun

## Outcome

Reruns stay documented without manual HTML editing, preserving compliance with WRK-624’s “learning unit” requirement.
