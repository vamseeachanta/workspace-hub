# feat: Client Roadshow Brochures — Client 1 & Client 2 (2-page each)

## What

Two-page client-facing brochures for the engineering AI roadshow. First drafts created at
`specs/client-demos/` in workspace-hub. Remaining work: PDF generation + client-repo placement.

### Brochures Created (50% done)

| File | Client | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `specs/client-demos/brochure-client1-rigid-jumper-pipeline.md` | Client 1 | Draft ✓ |
| `specs/client-demos/brochure-client2-structural-maritime.md` | Client 2 | Draft ✓ |

### Structure (both brochures)

**Page 1 — Engineering Areas**
- 4 focus areas per client with specific capabilities listed
- Sample Q&A table: question → manual time → AI time

**Page 2 — Roadmap & Next Steps**
- 4-phase deployment diagram (Demo → Teams Bot → RAG → QC)
- Known limitations (honest, builds trust)
- ROI table (5 metrics, 70–92% time reduction)
- Pilot proposal (4-week path to Teams deployment)

### Remaining Work

1. **Review and refine** — validate capability claims match system prompt content
   once WRK-632 (fundamentals) and WRK-633 (skills) are complete
2. **PDF generation** — run `data:md-to-pdf` skill to produce print-ready PDFs
3. **Copy to client repos** — place in `<client-repo>/docs/marketing/` when repos exist
4. **Personalise** — add client-specific colour scheme / logo placeholder if needed

## Skills Required

- `business/client-demo/engineering-chatbot` (WRK-633 — creates this)
- `data:md-to-pdf` — markdown → styled PDF via Chrome headless

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Both markdown brochures reviewed and accurate against system prompt content
- [x] PDF generated for each brochure (`brochure-client1-*.pdf`, `brochure-client2-*.pdf`)
- [x] PDFs placed in `specs/client-demos/` and committed
- [ ] Brochures copied to respective client repos under `docs/marketing/` when repos exist (deferred — repos TBD)
- [x] No client company names or proprietary data in any file
- [x] Legal scan passes (generic client references only)

## Agentic AI Horizon

Simple: markdown already written. Remaining = PDF render + file placement.
`data:md-to-pdf` skill handles conversion. Low risk.
