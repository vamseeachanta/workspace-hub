# Agent-readable specs index — YAML index of all specs consumable by AI agents

## What

Build a structured index of all specs/ directories across 20 submodules. Single YAML file
agents can query to locate specs by topic, repo, or WRK reference. Auto-updated by nightly
cron. Overlaps with Phase E registry — coordinate.

## Why

AI agents working across the workspace need to discover relevant specs quickly. Currently,
agents must glob across all submodules to find specs, which is slow and pollutes context.
A centralised YAML index enables O(1) spec lookup by topic, repo, or WRK reference.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Python script to scan specs/ directories across all submodules
- [x] Output: single YAML file at workspace-hub level (e.g., `specs/INDEX.yaml`)
- [x] Index entries: spec path, repo, title, WRK references, last modified date
- [x] Queryable by: topic keyword, repo name, WRK-NNN reference
- [x] Nightly cron integration (add to comprehensive-learning or standalone)
- [x] Coordinate with Phase E registry to avoid duplication
- [x] Pytest coverage for index generation and query functions
