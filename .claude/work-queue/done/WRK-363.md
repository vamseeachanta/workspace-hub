## Problem

Cron jobs are not consistently deployed across all workstations. Current state
as of 2026-02-23:

| Machine | session-analysis | model-ids | skills-curation | **comprehensive-learning** |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| ace-linux-1 | ✓ 3AM daily | ✓ Sun 3:30AM | ✓ Mon 4AM | ❌ MISSING |
| ace-linux-2 | ❌ NO CRONTAB | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| acma-ansys05 | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown |
| acma-ws014 | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown |

The comprehensive-learning nightly pipeline (v2.1.0) is fully built and tested
but has never been scheduled even on ace-linux-1, the designated host.

## Fix

### ace-linux-1 (add comprehensive-learning)
```bash
# Add to crontab (run at 2AM daily, before session-analysis at 3AM)
0 2 * * * bash /mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/scripts/cron/comprehensive-learning-nightly.sh >> /tmp/comprehensive-learning.log 2>&1
```

### ace-linux-2 (full cron setup)
SSH in and establish complete crontab matching ace-linux-1 schedule.
Path: `/mnt/workspace-hub` (different from ace-linux-1).

### Office machines (acma-ansys05, acma-ws014)
Audit what is running; deploy session-analysis and model-ids as minimum.
comprehensive-learning runs only on ace-linux-1 (single-machine guard in SKILL.md).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ace-linux-1: comprehensive-learning cron added (2AM daily) — already present pre-task
- [x] ace-linux-1: `crontab -l` verified — all 4 jobs present (comprehensive-learning 2AM, session-analysis 3AM, model-ids Sun 3:30AM, skills-curation Mon 4AM + repo-sync every 4h)
- [x] ace-linux-2: full crontab deployed (session-analysis, model-ids, skills-curation) — deployed 2026-02-24 via SSH
- [x] ace-linux-2: comprehensive-learning NOT added (ace-linux-1 is designated host)
- [x] Office machines: cron audit completed — see note below
- [x] `/tmp/comprehensive-learning.log` shows successful run within 24h — last run 2026-02-24T02:00
- [x] Cron schedule documented in `.claude/docs/new-machine-setup.md` (WRK-313) — Section 5 covers all machines and schedules

## Office Machine Audit (2026-02-24)

Both office machines are Windows workstations (role: `contribute-minimal`). Neither uses
cron — they use Windows Task Scheduler per `crontab-template.sh` and `setup-cron.sh`.

| Machine | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| ACMA-ANSYS05 | DNS unreachable from ace-linux-1 | Office LAN (192.168.0.x), Tailscale needed |
| acma-ws014 | Pingable (192.168.1.132), SSH refused | Windows — no OpenSSH server; Task Scheduler unknown |

Action: Both machines require manual Task Scheduler setup by the operator when on-site.
Instructions are in `scripts/cron/setup-cron.sh` (run on Windows prints Task Scheduler steps)
and `.claude/docs/new-machine-setup.md` § Windows Task Scheduler.
comprehensive-learning is explicitly excluded from both (ace-linux-1 only).

## Final State (2026-02-24)

| Machine | session-analysis | model-ids | skills-curation | comprehensive-learning |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| ace-linux-1 | ✓ 3AM daily | ✓ Sun 3:30AM | ✓ Mon 4AM | ✓ 2AM daily |
| ace-linux-2 | ✓ 3AM daily | ✓ Sun 3:30AM | ✓ Mon 4AM | ✗ (correct — not this host) |
| ACMA-ANSYS05 | pending (Windows, Tailscale needed) | pending | N/A | N/A |
| acma-ws014 | pending (Windows, manual setup) | pending | N/A | N/A |
