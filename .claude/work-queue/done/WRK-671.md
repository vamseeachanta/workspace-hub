# test(review): orchestrator gate run with Gemini

## Problem

Gemini has served as a reviewer (WRK-657) but never as the orchestrator enforcing the WRK-624 gate sequence. WRK-656 requires a validator-verifiable evidence pack that proves Gemini can deliver plan, review, TDD, legal, and validator artifacts before claiming work execution.

## What

Launch a `/work` session for WRK-671 with Gemini as the orchestrator. Produce plan HTML (with human confirmation), cross-review artifacts, tests, legal scan results, and the claim evidence manifest, storing everything under `assets/WRK-671/`. Validate using `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-671`.

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Artifact preparation

- clone or reference the WRK-657 plan/review assets to stabilize the Orion prompt.
- ensure `assets/WRK-671/` contains path placeholders before execution (plan review, review summary, variation tests, legal, claim evidence).

### Phase 2 — Gemini orchestrator session

- run `/work run WRK-671`, letting Gemini navigate plan, cross-review (with Claude/Codex as reviewers), TDD, and legal stages.
- collect stage logs (`.claude/work-queue/logs/WRK-671-*.log`) and confirm human sign-off within the plan HTML artifact.
- capture cross-review verdicts, including how Gemini classifies NO_OUTPUT scenarios, in `assets/WRK-671/review.html`.

### Phase 3 — Validation

- execute `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-671` and record the CLI output alongside `assets/WRK-671/claim-evidence.yaml`.
- author a summary HTML (matching the previous reports) explaining any skipped stages and linking to the stage logs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Gemini-run artifacts (plan, review, TDD, legal, claim evidence) are stored under `assets/WRK-671/`.
- [ ] Logs exist for start, plan, cross-review, and close.
- [ ] `verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-671` exits 0 referencing the claim evidence manifest.
- [ ] Summary HTML explains why resource intelligence/user/final review stages were skipped or executed and documents the human confirmation button/link.

## Evidence

- `assets/WRK-671/plan-html-review-final.md`
- `assets/WRK-671/review.html`
- `.claude/work-queue/logs/WRK-671-*.log`
- `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-671` output

## Outcome

Gemini now has an explicit orchestrator run; the results can be compared with Claude and Codex before choosing the most reliable orchestrator for WRK-656 and future gate-sensitive work.
