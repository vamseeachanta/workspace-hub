# The Well — planetswe Dataset Integration with worldenergydata/metocean

## What

Integrate the `planetswe` (Shallow Water Equations / planetary waves) dataset from The Well
(Polymathic AI) into `worldenergydata/metocean/` as a supplementary training and validation
data source for wave modelling modules.

The Well package: `pip install the_well` (v1.2.0, CC BY 4.0)
Dataset: `planetswe` — 2D shallow water equations on rotating sphere, planetary-scale waves

## Why

WRK-393 identified `planetswe` as a top-3 integration candidate: overlaps with metocean
wave modelling (shallow water wave equations are foundational to ocean wave propagation).
Having benchmark simulation data available enables:
- Validating analytical wave propagation models in worldenergydata
- Training surrogate models for wave speed/amplitude prediction
- Testing new metocean analysis routines against ground-truth physics solutions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `the_well` package added to worldenergydata optional deps (`pyproject.toml`)
- [x] `worldenergydata/metocean/well_datasets/` module created with `planetswe_loader.py`
- [x] `PlanetsweLoader.stream_sample(n_steps=10)` returns DataLoader of wave snapshots
- [x] Integration test: smoke test that streams 10 steps without downloading full dataset
  (uses Hugging Face streaming — no 15 TB download)
- [x] Example notebook or script: `docs/examples/planetswe_wave_validation.py`
- [x] Attribution: CC BY 4.0 attribution comment in all files using The Well data
- [x] Tests pass: `PYTHONPATH="src:../assetutilities/src" python3 -m pytest tests/ -k planetswe`
  19/19 passed (2026-02-24)

## Implementation Notes

License: CC BY 4.0 (commercial use OK with attribution). See WRK-393 evaluation doc.
Streaming pattern: `from the_well.data import WellDataset; ds = WellDataset("planetswe")`

## Agentic AI Horizon

- SWE dataset enables physics-informed wave modelling validation without proprietary data
- Foundation for surrogate model training (H2) once pipeline (WRK-380) runs across parameter space
- **Disposition: invest now** — low friction (pip install), high metocean relevance
