# Sector exposure tracker — auto-classify holdings by GICS sector and flag concentration

## What

Auto-classify portfolio holdings by GICS sector using yfinance fundamentals. Track sector
weights, flag over-concentration (>30% single sector). Output: sector breakdown chart,
rebalancing suggestions. Wire into daily strategy output.

## Why

Sector concentration is a key portfolio risk factor. Automatic GICS classification and
concentration monitoring ensures diversification is maintained without manual tracking. A 30%
single-sector threshold provides an early warning for rebalancing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] GICS sector classification pull from yfinance for each holding
- [x] Sector weight calculation (market value weighted)
- [x] Concentration flag: warning when any sector exceeds 30% of portfolio
- [x] Sector breakdown output: table and bar chart (matplotlib or console)
- [x] Rebalancing suggestions: sectors to trim/add based on target allocation
- [x] Wire into existing daily strategy output
- [x] Pytest coverage with sample portfolio and known sector classifications
