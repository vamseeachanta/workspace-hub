# feat(calculations): implement API TR 5C3 (2008) Technical Report on...

## Standard
- **ID**: API TR 5C3 (2008) Technical Report on Equations and Calculations for Casing, Tubing, and Line Pipe Used as Casing or Tubing; and Performance Properties Tables for Casing and Tubing
- **Title**: API TR 5C3 (2008) Technical Report on Equations and Calculations for Casing, Tubing, and Line Pipe Used as Casing or Tub
- **Org**: API
- **Document**: `/mnt/ace/docs/_standards/raw/0000 Codes & Standards/AS/API/API Technical Report/API TR 5C3 (2008) Technical Report on Equations and Calculations for Casing, Tubing, and Line Pipe Used as Casing or Tubing; and Performance Properties Tables for Casing and Tubing.pdf` (SHA: `adb382622fa7dca4...`)
- **Summary**: Technical Report on Equations and Calculations for Casing, Tubing, and Line Pipe Used as Casing or ISO 10400:2007 (Identical), Petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries-Equations and calc...
- **Discipline**: pipeline

## Target Module
- **Repo**: assetutilities
- **Module**: `calculations`
- **Current status**: gap (no implementation found)
- **Capability tier target**: Tier 1 (deterministic calculation)

## What to Implement
Technical Report on Equations and Calculations for Casing, Tubing, and Line Pipe Used as Casing or ISO 10400:2007 (Identical), Petroleum, petrochemical and natural gas industries-Equations and calculations for the

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Function implements API TR 5C3 (2008) Technical Report on... calculation (burst, collapse, axial, wall thickness, temperature derating)
- [x] Unit tests cover nominal and edge cases (35 tests pass)
- [x] Result validated against worked example in standard (if available)
- [x] Module registry updated: status → implemented

## Implementation Note
Implementation shared with WRK-420: `assetutilities/calculations/casing_pipe.py`
Single implementation (API 5C3 / ISO-TR 10400 aligned) covers WRK-420 through WRK-424.
35 tests pass covering burst, collapse, axial load, wall thickness, and temperature derating.

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Standards implementation is direct engineering value: agents can invoke
  API TR 5C3 (2008) Technical Report on... calculations in automated workflows
- **Disposition: invest now** — engineering standards code is foundational
  and non-perishable
