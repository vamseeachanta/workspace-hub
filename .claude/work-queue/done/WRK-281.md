# Fix 2H legacy project discoverability (navigation layer)

## What

17 projects were migrated from `2H/` to `docs/clients/unknown/projects/` but are now hard to
find. Original project names (e.g., "31098 - Grupo-R Piklis-1DL") do not map intuitively to
standardised slugs. Remaining `2H/` projects have no navigation to their new locations.

## Why

Blocked by WRK-279 — the governance decision on the Codex relocation plan must come first to
determine whether any further migration proceeds. Once that decision is committed, this item
builds a navigation layer over whatever state exists.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/mnt/ace/2H/MIGRATION_MAP.md` created — table of: original folder → new path → 1-line description (all 17 migrated projects)
- [ ] Each `README_MIGRATED.md` verified to point to an existing target path; broken links fixed
- [ ] `/mnt/ace/2H/INDEX.md` created listing all 17 migrated projects with links, plus unmigrated projects in-place
- [ ] Each `docs/clients/unknown/projects/<slug>/README.md` has original `2H/` folder name in first line
- [ ] Human can find any legacy 2H project within 2 lookups

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Navigation layer creation (index files, pointer verification) is highly automatable.
- After WRK-279 provides the decision record, an agent can build this layer systematically
  across all 17 projects in one pass.
