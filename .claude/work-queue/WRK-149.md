# WRK-149: Expand validation summary with hydrostatic, matrix, and phase columns

## Status: pending
## Priority: low
## Module: hydrodynamics/diffraction

## Context

The validation_summary.html now has a Semantic column (added in session 2026-02-16-semantic-summary). Review identified additional data that exists in benchmark artifacts but isn't surfaced in the master summary table.

## Available data NOT yet surfaced

### Tier 1 — Already in benchmark_report.json (low effort)
- **Added mass matrix correlation**: `added_mass_correlations` — 6x6 diagonal could be summarized as min/mean
- **Damping matrix correlation**: `damping_correlations` — same structure
- **Phase correlation per DOF**: `pairwise_results[*].rao_comparisons[dof].phase_correlation`
- **Max phase diff per DOF**: `pairwise_results[*].rao_comparisons[dof].max_phase_diff`

### Tier 2 — Requires pipeline changes (medium effort)
- **Hydrostatic comparison**: CoG, CoB, waterplane area, hydrostatic stiffness matrix — exists in solver_metadata extraction (`solver_metadata.py:build_orcawave_metadata_from_yml`) but NOT exported to JSON
- **Serialize semantic diffs to JSON**: Currently `_semantic_equivalence` is only printed to console and stored in HTML metadata — not in benchmark_report.json

### Tier 3 — Requires new data pipelines (high effort)
- **Mesh quality metrics**: Adjacent panel ratio, aspect ratio, skewness — not captured anywhere
- **Mesh file fingerprinting**: Hash to verify same geometry used by both solvers
- **Frequency-dependent correlation profiles**: Per-frequency band agreement analysis

## Recommendation

- Tier 1 items could be added as summary columns (e.g. "AM" for added mass min diagonal r, "Phase" for worst-case phase correlation)
- Consider a tooltip or expandable row rather than many columns — table is already wide
- Hydrostatic export to JSON is prerequisite for Tier 2
