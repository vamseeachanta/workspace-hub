# Market digitalmodel and worldenergydata capabilities on aceengineer website

## What
Roll digitalmodel (engineering asset lifecycle platform) and worldenergydata (energy data aggregation platform) capabilities into the aceengineer-website for marketing. Add new service pages, update navigation, enhance energy.html, add new vertical sections targeting energy data clients, and create lead-generation content to attract projects and business.

## Why
The website currently markets only engineering automation (OrcaFlex, AQWA, fatigue). Two major product capabilities are missing from the website:
1. **digitalmodel** — 47+ analysis modules, 221 S-N curves, digital twin workflows, multi-software integration
2. **worldenergydata** — 15+ global energy data sources, marine safety intelligence, field development economics (NPV/IRR), production analytics

Adding these expands the addressable market from offshore engineering firms to include energy operators, investors, consultancies, maritime companies, and regulators.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] New "Energy Data & Analytics" service page created with worldenergydata capabilities
- [x] energy.html completely revamped with marketing-grade content (matching engineering.html quality)
- [x] New vertical sections for energy data clients (operators, investors, maritime)
- [x] Homepage updated with new service offerings in verticals section
- [x] Navigation updated to reflect new service structure
- [x] JSON-LD structured data added for new service pages
- [x] New metrics section reflecting combined platform capabilities
- [x] Contact form updated with new industry vertical options
- [x] All pages maintain Lighthouse 100 scores
- [x] Consistent design with existing marketing.css patterns
