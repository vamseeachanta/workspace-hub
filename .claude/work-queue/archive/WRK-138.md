# Fitness-for-Service Module Enhancement: Wall Thickness Grid, Industry Targeting, and Asset Lifecycle

## What
Enhance the existing FFS module (renamed from `pyintegrity` to `asset_integrity` at `src/digitalmodel/asset_integrity/`) to support:
1. **Wall thickness grid input** — accept a grid of wall thickness measurements (e.g. from UT inspection) and produce Level 1 and Level 2 assessment results with acceptance/rejection outcomes
2. **Existing examples** — catalog and add working examples of FFS assessments before new development proceeds
3. **Target industry coverage** — explicitly support pipelines, upstream facilities, midstream infrastructure, and downstream equipment with industry-specific parameters and code references
4. **Asset lifecycle integration** — incorporate remaining life estimation, inspection interval recommendations, and degradation trending across the lifecycle of an asset

## Why
The current module (renamed to `asset_integrity`) has strong API 579 calculation foundations but lacks a streamlined workflow for the common real-world use case: an engineer receives a wall thickness grid from UT inspection and needs quick Level 1/2 acceptance screening. Adding industry-specific templates and lifecycle tracking makes the module practical for production engineering workflows across oil & gas sectors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Module renamed from pyintegrity to asset_integrity
- [x] All imports fixed (absolute → relative)
- [x] Legal compliance scan passed (zero violations)
- [x] Marketing brochure corrected with honest capability inventory
- [ ] Wall thickness grid input (CSV, array, or YAML) accepted and mapped to component geometry
- [ ] Level 1 assessment: minimum measured thickness vs. required thickness → accept/reject
- [ ] Level 2 assessment: remaining strength factor (RSF) calculation for local thin areas → accept/reject
- [ ] Clear output report showing grid results, governing locations, and accept/reject per API 579
- [ ] Existing examples cataloged and verified working (at least 3 example configurations)
- [ ] Industry-specific parameter sets: pipelines (B31.4/B31.8), upstream vessels (Div 1/2), midstream piping
- [ ] Asset lifecycle module: corrosion rate trending → remaining life → next inspection date
- [ ] Tests for each enhancement with at least one known benchmark per assessment level
- [ ] Documentation of API 579 clause references for all new calculations

## Phase 0 Completion (2026-02-13)
- **Commit**: digitalmodel `f5b22e6f8` (145 files, 424+/456-)
- **Rename**: `data_systems/pyintegrity/` → `asset_integrity/` with backward-compat shim
- **Import fixes**: 21 Python files converted from absolute to relative imports
- **Legal remediation**: 24 config/test YAML files, 7 file renames, 5 deny-list patterns
- **Brochure**: Rewritten with honest [Implemented]/[Partial]/[Planned] markers
- **Audit**: PipeCapacity.py — 7 design codes, 16 equations (9 correct, 2 suspect, 2 not-implemented)

## Remaining Phases
- **Phase 1**: Wall thickness grid → Level 1/2 assessment workflow
- **Phase 2**: Industry-specific parameter sets and templates
- **Phase 3**: Asset lifecycle (corrosion trending, remaining life, inspection intervals)
- **Phase 4**: Integration testing, documentation, brochure finalization

*Source: fitness-for-service module work enhancement to be able to give a wall thickness grid and get level 1, level 2 end result acceptance. Add existing examples prior to proceeding. Target industries (pipelines, upstream, midstream etc.). Address lifecycle of an asset.*
