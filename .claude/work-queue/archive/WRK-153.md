> **Superseded** — This case study should be rebuilt on calibrated cost data (WRK-019) and cost calibration (WRK-171). Executing now produces proxy-based estimates that will need to be redone. See WRK-258 for the blocked successor.

# Energy Data Case Study — BSEE Field Economics

## What
Create a case study HTML page showing BSEE field production data analysis with NPV/IRR calculations. WRK-078 was planned but never executed. Leverages existing decline curve module (WRK-077, delivered) and Buckskin analysis (WRK-024, delivered).

## Why
- GTM strategy (WRK-146/148) needs concrete portfolio pieces
- Marine safety case study exists (WRK-079) but no energy data case study
- All data and analytics modules are already built — just needs the showcase page

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Case study HTML page in case-studies/ directory
- [ ] Shows real BSEE production data analysis for a Gulf of Mexico field
- [ ] Includes NPV/IRR calculation results from decline curve forecasts
- [ ] Metrics section with key numbers
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data
- [ ] Linked from energy.html and case-studies/index.html

## Notes
- Original WRK-078 plan available in archive (cross-reviewed 2026-02-09)
- Use Buckskin field (WRK-024) as the showcase — all data already generated
- Follow pattern of marine safety case study (WRK-079)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- BSEE field economics case study for the aceengineer website combines worldenergydata analysis with NPV/IRR workflow — a high-impact demonstration of the platform's capabilities.
- The case study requires domain expertise and data integration; improved AI will generate better reports but the analytical framework and data sources need to be in place first.
- **Disposition: invest now** — a compelling case study drives client credibility; publishing one now while the BSEE pipeline is fresh maximises its marketing value.
