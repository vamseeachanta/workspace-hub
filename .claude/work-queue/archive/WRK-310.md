# Daily network-mount readiness check — DONE

## What

`scripts/readiness/check-network-mounts.sh` deployed as daily root cron on both
`ace-linux-1` and `ace-linux-2`.

## Completed

- [x] Script written and committed — `96b0ea5`
- [x] Dry run ace-linux-1: `ok=2 recovered=0 failed=0` ✅
- [x] Dry run ace-linux-2: `ok=3 recovered=0 failed=0` ✅
- [x] Root known_hosts pre-seeded on both machines (ssh-keyscan 2026-02-22)
- [x] Cron installed on ace-linux-1 (`0 7 * * *`)
- [x] Cron installed on ace-linux-2 (`0 7 * * *`)

## Mounts checked daily

**ace-linux-1:** `/mnt/remote/ace-linux-2/local-analysis`, `/mnt/remote/ace-linux-2/dde`

**ace-linux-2:** `/mnt/workspace-hub`, `/mnt/remote/ace-linux-1/local-analysis`, `/mnt/remote/ace-linux-1/ace`

## Log locations

- ace-linux-1: `.claude/state/session-signals/network-mounts-cron.log` + `network-mounts.jsonl`
- ace-linux-2: `/tmp/network-mounts-cron.log`

## Future

- Integrate JSONL into comprehensive-learning Phase 1 signals
- Add ntfy/email alert on persistent failure (exit 1)
