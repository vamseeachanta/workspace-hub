# Diffraction spec converter skill — register as named agent-callable skill

## What
Register the unified diffraction spec converter (spec.yml → AQWA/OrcaWave backends, mesh converter, CLI, reverse parsers) as a named agent-callable skill with documented inputs/outputs. Add an "import legacy model" workflow to the skill.

## Why
All six sub-items of the converter suite were delivered but no skill is registered. Agents discovering a diffraction analysis task won't find this capability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skill registered in `.claude/skills/eng/`
- [ ] Invocation patterns documented for both forward (spec→backend) and reverse (backend→spec) conversion
- [ ] "Import legacy model" workflow documented
- [ ] Agent can discover and invoke with no additional context

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Foundational infrastructure for hydrodynamic analysis automation — without skill registration, agents cannot discover this capability
- All converter code is complete; registration is purely metadata work that agents cannot self-perform
- **Disposition: invest now** — converter is done, registration is minimal effort with high discoverability payoff
