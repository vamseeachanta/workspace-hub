# Orient all work items toward agentic AI future-boosting, not just task completion

## What

Four deliverables:

1. **Backfill active work items** — review all pending/working/blocked WRK items and add an `## Agentic AI Horizon` section with an appropriate assessment to each
2. **Mine archived work items for follow-ups** — read all 135 archived items; identify any where the agentic AI trajectory suggests follow-up work that wasn't obvious at delivery time; produce a list of follow-up WRK candidates (read-only — do not edit archived files)
3. **Update the work queue template and plan gate** — so all future items include the section by default, and it is a required gate before `plan_approved: true`
4. **Create an `agentic-horizon` skill** — a standing weekly skill that re-evaluates horizon notes across all active work items as the agentic AI landscape evolves and updates assessments accordingly

## Why

The inflection point is 3–4 months away. Work done today that doesn't account for this trajectory is likely wasted effort — or worse, technical debt that agentic tools will need to unpick. The right frame is: every item should either (a) directly boost what agents can do next, (b) build infrastructure agents will leverage, or (c) be explicitly accepted as necessary-now-but-superseded-soon. Items that are just "get it done" with no future-boost rationale should be challenged or deprioritised. The weekly skill keeps assessments fresh as the landscape shifts — an item that was "wait 2 months" in February may be "ready now" in April.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `## Agentic AI Horizon` section added to all active (pending/working/blocked) WRK items with a meaningful assessment — not a placeholder
- [ ] All 135 archived items analysed for follow-up candidates; list produced at `.claude/docs/archive-horizon-followups.md` — items that warrant re-opening or spawning a new WRK item given the 3–4 month agentic trajectory
- [ ] Section prompts:
  - *Does this work boost agentic AI capability in this ecosystem?*
  - *Will an agent handle this better in 3–4 months — if so: (a) wait, (b) invest differently now, (c) park it as a future WRK item to revisit in 1–2 months, or (d) do the groundwork now and park the rest for when capability catches up?*
  - *How should this work be shaped to maximise future leverage, not just complete the task?*
- [ ] Work item template in `SKILL.md` updated with the section and prompts
- [ ] `process.md` plan gate updated: horizon section required before `plan_approved: true
auto_execute: true`
- [ ] `agentic-horizon` skill created at `.claude/skills/coordination/workspace/agentic-horizon/SKILL.md` with:
  - Weekly cadence (`trigger: scheduled`, `cadence: weekly`)
  - `auto_execute: true` — agent runs autonomously, surfaces reassessments for user review
  - Logic: scan active WRK items, identify stale horizon notes, update based on current agentic landscape, flag items whose disposition has changed (e.g. "wait" → "ready now", or "do now" → "park it")

## Plan

1. **Update template** — edit `SKILL.md` work item format section; add `## Agentic AI Horizon` with the three prompts ✅
2. **Update process gate** — edit `process.md` plan gate; add horizon section as required field before approval ✅
3. **Backfill active items** — agent reads each pending/working/blocked WRK item, writes a concise horizon assessment; batched, one pass per status bucket; user reviews a sample before full run ✅ (84 items backfilled, 10 already had section)
4. **Mine archived items** — agent reads all 135 archived WRK items; identifies follow-up candidates; writes `.claude/docs/archive-horizon-followups.md`; does NOT edit archived files ✅ (42 candidates from 135 items — 31% hit rate)
5. **Create skill** — write `.claude/skills/coordination/workspace/agentic-horizon/SKILL.md` with weekly schedule, scan logic (active items + archived mine), and reassessment workflow ✅

*Source: "all our work items should always have a note to review how to get work done in the age of agentic ai — adjust work accordingly, work for future boosting not get work done today. WRK-228 should: a/ review all existing work items and add appropriate notes, b/ added to work-queue plan. Should also have an agentic horizon skill updated weekly"*
