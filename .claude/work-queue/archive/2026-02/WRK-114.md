# Collect Hull Panel Shapes and Sizes for Various Floating Bodies

## What
Inventory, collect, and catalog hull panel geometries from multiple existing sources across the workspace. These panels can be used as-is or scaled up/down based on principal dimensions of other hulls for diffraction/hydrodynamic analysis.

## Why
Hull panel meshes are scattered across multiple repos and project directories. Consolidating them into a structured, accessible collection enables rapid hull selection and scaling for new analyses without re-creating geometry from scratch. This feeds into the parametric hull analysis pipeline (WRK-043) and solver benchmarking (WRK-031).

## Sources

### a) OrcaWave Validation Panels
- **Path**: `digitalmodel/docs/modules/orcawave/L00_validation_wamit`
- **Content**: Validation hull panels used in WAMIT benchmarking
- **Use case**: Reference geometries that can be scaled based on principal dimensions of target hulls

### b) Hull Panels Collection
- **Path**: `acma-projects/_hulls`
- **Content**: Dedicated hull panel collection
- **Use case**: Pre-existing hull geometries for various vessel types

### c) Rock Oil Field Hulls
- **Path**: `rock-oil-field/s7`
- **Content**: Hull panels available in this project folder (needs discovery)
- **Use case**: Additional floating body geometries

### d) WLNG and Varying LNGC Hulls
- **Path**: `acma-projects/B1522/ctr-7/_src/aqwa/rev_a08`
- **Content**: WLNG (floating LNG) and varying LNGC (LNG Carrier) hull panel models
- **Use case**: LNG-class vessel geometries for side-by-side and standalone analyses

### e) Saipem Yellowtail FPSO Hulls
- **Path**: `saipem/yellowtail`
- **Content**: Hull panels from Yellowtail FPSO project (needs discovery)
- **Use case**: FPSO hull geometries for spread-moored/turret-moored vessel analyses

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Inventory all hull panel files from each source (format, panel count, dimensions, hull type)
- [x] Catalog hull principal dimensions (LOA, beam, draft, displacement where available)
- [x] Consolidate panels into a structured directory in digitalmodel (e.g., `data/hull_panels/`)
- [x] Create a hull catalog YAML/CSV with metadata per hull (name, type, source, dimensions, panel count, file format)
- [x] Verify panels load correctly (GDF, DAT, or other mesh formats)
- [x] Document scaling approach: how to resize hull panels based on target principal dimensions
- [x] Legal scan: sanitize any client-specific references before committing consolidated data
- [x] Tests: loader reads each hull, validates panel count and bounding box dimensions

## Notes
- Source paths in acma-projects and saipem may contain client project references — must sanitize per legal-compliance.md before porting
- Hull panels may be in various formats: GDF (WAMIT), DAT (AQWA), mesh text, etc.
- Scaling methodology: uniform or non-uniform scaling based on L/B/T ratios
