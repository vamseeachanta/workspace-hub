# UKCS Production Data Module — NSTA/OPRED Open Data Integration

## Motivation

WRK-190 adds Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) data via NPD/Sodir. The UK side
of the North Sea — the UKCS — is the natural companion:
- Same geological basin, very different fiscal regime (UK vs Norway)
- Rich open data from NSTA (North Sea Transition Authority, formerly OGA) and
  OPRED (Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning)
- Enables cross-basin economics: NCS vs GoM vs UKCS in the same worldenergydata framework

Together with BSEE (GoM) and NPD (NCS), UKCS completes coverage of the three
major basins where Aker BP, BP, Shell, Equinor, and TotalEnergies operate simultaneously.

## Data Sources

**NSTA Open Data** (`https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/data-centre/`):
- Annual and monthly field production (oil, gas, water)
- Well data: completions, tests, logs
- Licensed block/field polygons (GIS)
- Decommissioning data
- Emissions data (CO₂/methane per field)

**OPRED** (`https://www.gov.uk/guidance/oil-and-gas-offshore-environmental-expenditure`):
- Environmental expenditure
- Decommissioning cost data (valuable for late-life field economics)

**Format**: CSV downloads + some REST API endpoints (verify current NSTA API status)

## Fields of Interest (initial set)

| Field | Operator | Type | Why |
|-------|----------|------|-----|
| Elgin-Franklin | TotalEnergies | HPHT gas-condensate | Complex development; benchmark CAPEX |
| Buzzard | CNOOC | Large oil field | Peak production ~200 kbopd; decline well-documented |
| Forties | Apache | Mature giant | Oldest UKCS field with complete production history |
| Clair Ridge | BP | Platform | West of Shetland; large discovered resource |
| Mariner | Equinor | FPSO | Heavy oil; subsea-to-FPSO development type |
| Culzean | TotalEnergies | HPHT platform | High-profile recent development; gas field |

## Module Structure

```
worldenergydata/
  ukcs/
    __init__.py
    production/
      __init__.py
      field_production.py       # Monthly/annual production loader
      decline_curves.py         # DCA (mirrors bsee + ncs pattern)
    wells/
      __init__.py
      well_loader.py
    analysis/
      __init__.py
      field_economics.py        # UK fiscal regime: RFCT + Supplementary Charge + EPL
    data/                       # Cached NSTA data
```

## UKCS Fiscal Regime (distinct from BSEE/NCS)

| Component | Rate | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Ring Fence Corporation Tax (RFCT) | 30% | Ring-fenced profits |
| Supplementary Charge | 10% | Additional levy on ring-fenced profits |
| Energy Profits Levy (EPL) | 35% | Windfall tax, currently to 2030 |
| Investment Allowance | 29% | Offsets EPL for qualifying capex |
| Effective marginal rate | ~78% | Same as Norway headline but different structure |

Economics module must model this correctly for cross-basin NPV comparison to be valid.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] NSTA API/CSV client with caching
- [ ] Monthly field production loader (oil, gas, water) for UKCS
- [ ] LFS stub handling for large data files
- [ ] Decline curve fitting for 3+ UKCS fields (Forties, Buzzard, Mariner)
- [ ] UK fiscal regime modelled in `field_economics.py` (RFCT + SC + EPL + IA)
- [ ] Cross-basin comparison example: Solveig (NCS) vs Buzzard (UKCS) vs Atlantis (GoM)
- [ ] 30+ tests
- [ ] Blocked by WRK-190 (NCS module establishes the pattern to mirror)

## Plan Notes

WRK-190 (NCS) defines the module structure and loader pattern. WRK-193 should
be implemented immediately after WRK-190 is complete, using the same scaffolding
with NSTA-specific API client and UKCS fiscal regime additions. Estimated ~80%
of code is structurally identical to WRK-190 once the API client is resolved.

## Agentic AI Horizon

- UKCS production data (NSTA/OPRED) extends worldenergydata to UK North Sea — expands the regional coverage and enables North Sea benchmarking alongside GoM and Norway.
- Data integration work has time value (data freshness); improved models won't automate the NSTA API integration and schema mapping.
- **Disposition: do now** — UKCS is the third major offshore basin after GoM (BSEE) and Norway (Sodir); adding it now gives the worldenergydata platform meaningful global coverage.
