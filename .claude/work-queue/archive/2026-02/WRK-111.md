# BSEE Field Development Interactive Map and Analytics

## What

Build an interactive map-based visualization of BSEE Gulf of Mexico oil & gas fields, inspired by [mineralrights.ai/map](https://www.mineralrights.ai/map). Combine BSEE field/lease geospatial data with production analytics from the worldenergydata module to create a field development exploration tool.

## Why

The existing BSEE data modules (production, field names, geological era classification from WRK-011) contain rich field-level data but lack spatial visualization. An interactive map would:
1. Make field-level production data explorable by location
2. Visualize field development patterns across the GOM
3. Serve as a portfolio showcase for aceengineer-website
4. Complement the GIS timeline work planned in WRK-023

## Reference

- **mineralrights.ai/map**: Interactive mineral rights map platform with section-level detail drawers, geographic visualization of mineral/lease data. Serves as UX inspiration for field-level drill-down.

## Ideas / Feature Concepts

### Data Layer: BSEE Fields
- Field boundaries/centroids from BSEE public shapefiles (BOEM GIS data)
- Production summary per field (from `mv_productionsum.bin` — 39 years of totals)
- Field names and geological era classification (from WRK-011 modules)
- Water depth classification (shallow/deepwater/ultra-deepwater)
- Operator history and active lease counts

### Data Layer: Well-Level (stretch)
- Well locations from BSEE borehole data
- Production by well (requires LFS pull or ZIP regen for `mv_productiondata.bin`)
- Paleowells geological era overlay (458 classified wells from WRK-011)

### Visualization Concepts
- Choropleth or bubble map of fields by cumulative production
- Color coding by geological era (Oligocene/Eocene/Paleocene)
- Time slider for development history animation
- Click-to-expand field detail panel (production chart, top operators, well count)
- Water depth contour overlay

### Dynamic Loading Pattern (from mineralrights.ai)
- Site uses intelligent lazy loading — map tiles and data layers fetched on demand as user pans/zooms
- Section-level detail only loaded when user clicks a specific area (drawer component)
- Critical for BSEE data where full dataset is large (thousands of fields, tens of thousands of wells)
- Consider: GeoJSON tile server, or pre-split data by OCS region/protraction area for chunked loading
- Vector tiles (MVT/PMTiles) allow client-side rendering without loading full dataset

### Technology Options
- **Static SVG/HTML**: Generate from Python, serve as static site page (simplest)
- **Leaflet/MapLibre**: Interactive JS map with GeoJSON layers (richest UX)
- **Plotly/Folium**: Python-generated interactive maps (middle ground)
- **Deck.gl**: WebGL-based large-scale visualization (most performant for many points)

### Website Integration
- Embed as interactive page on aceengineer-website
- Field detail pages could link to engineering analysis capabilities
- Showcase data engineering + visualization portfolio

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] BOEM/BSEE GIS shapefile data sourced and loaded (field boundaries or centroids)
- [ ] Field-level production data joined to spatial data
- [ ] Interactive map with field markers/boundaries, color-coded by a metric
- [ ] Click/hover detail panel showing field production summary
- [ ] At least one filter dimension (water depth, era, production range)
- [ ] Deployable as static page or embeddable component
- [ ] Unit tests for data joins and spatial processing
- [ ] Documentation of data sources and update process

## Agentic AI Horizon

- BSEE field development interactive map and analytics is a high-visibility capability that agents can use to surface geographic patterns in field data — strong compounding value.
- Interactive map/analytics dashboards benefit from better data visualisation agents in 3–4 months; the underlying BSEE data pipeline is already built.
- **Disposition: invest now** — the map layer is the user-facing output of the BSEE pipeline; building it now lets the existing data investment produce visible value for client demos and website.
