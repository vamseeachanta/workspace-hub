# PHMSA pipeline safety case study — aceengineer website with data-to-assessment workflow

## What
Create a PHMSA pipeline safety case study for the aceengineer website. Use the existing pipeline_safety module (WRK-070) to show a data-to-assessment workflow linking PHMSA incident data → FFS skill (WRK-206) → accept/reject output.

## Why
The PHMSA module is built but not leveraged for client-facing content. Pipeline safety data is directly relevant to the FFS/asset integrity market. This is a marketing asset that demonstrates end-to-end capability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Case study published on aceengineer website
- [ ] Shows full data source → analysis → result workflow (PHMSA → FFS → verdict)
- [ ] Links to FFS skill (WRK-206)
- [ ] Agents can regenerate the content from the module without manual writing

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Marketing asset that also validates the agentic data-to-deliverable workflow
- Data and analysis exist; content generation is the gap — agents with good writing capability can produce the narrative
- **Disposition: do now** — data and analysis exist, content generation is the remaining work
