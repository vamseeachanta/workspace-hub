# Review Work Accomplishments & Draft Outreach Message

## What
1. Generate a comprehensive review of all work completed across workspace-hub repositories — features built, data pipelines, engineering modules, agent orchestration, etc.
2. Draft a professional outreach message to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei highlighting how Claude Code has been used in this workspace and offering collaboration or feedback for product development.

## Why
Document the breadth and depth of work accomplished using Claude Code as the primary development tool. Share real-world usage patterns and accomplishments that could inform Anthropic's product roadmap.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Work accomplishments report covering all archived WRK items with metrics (items completed, lines changed, modules built)
- [x] Categorized summary (data engineering, naval architecture, agent orchestration, DevOps tooling)
- [x] Draft outreach message (professional, concise, value-focused) ready for user to send manually
- [x] Message highlights unique use case: multi-repo engineering workspace with Claude as orchestrator
- [x] **SENT**: Dario Amodei connected/messaged on LinkedIn (2026-02-16)

## Notes
- User will send the message manually — this item only covers report generation and message drafting
- Draw from archive/ work items, git history, and memory for accomplishments data
- **GTM PDF** (`.claude/work-queue/assets/WRK-148/ace-gtm-strategy-2026-02-16.pdf`) has additional Anthropic targets: Alex Albert (X/DM), Boris Cherny (LinkedIn), Irina Ghose (LinkedIn)
