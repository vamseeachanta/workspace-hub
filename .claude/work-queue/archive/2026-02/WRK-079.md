# Create marine safety case study — cross-database incident correlation

## What
Write a case study showing cross-database marine safety incident correlation using actual USCG + NTSB data. Follow the existing case study HTML pattern.

## Why
Marine Safety Intelligence is a major marketed service with zero proof points on the website. A case study showing real incident correlation across databases validates the claim.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Case study HTML page in case-studies/ directory
- [x] Shows TSB + MAIB + BSEE cross-database correlation (adapted from USCG + NTSB plan; used actually-ingested sources)
- [x] Demonstrates deduplication and pattern detection
- [x] Includes incident trend data and type distribution tables
- [x] Metrics: 5 sources correlated, 269K+ records integrated, collision pattern found across jurisdictions
- [x] JSON-LD structured data
- [x] Linked from energy.html and case-studies/index.html

## Plan

**Target**: `aceengineer-website/case-studies/`

### Existing Assets (reuse)
- `marine_safety/cross_reference/correlation_engine.py` — fuzzy matching across sources
- Working scrapers: USCG, NTSB, ATSB (290K+ incidents)
- `marine_safety/analysis/` — trend analysis, pattern detection
- Existing case study HTML template pattern

### Phase 1 — Run Correlation Analysis
- **Define scope**: US waters, 2010-2023, USCG + NTSB + ATSB sources. Document exact query parameters for reproducibility.
- Execute correlation engine on defined data subset
- Document: N incidents correlated, M unique events identified, P duplicate records merged
- Document de-duplication rate calculation method (precision/recall estimates)
- Extract: top incident categories, temporal trends, geographic hotspots

### Phase 2 — Write Case Study
- `case-studies/marine-safety-correlation.html`:
  - Follow existing HTML/CSS pattern
  - Sections: Challenge (fragmented databases), Solution (cross-correlation), Results
  - Charts: incident trends, source overlap Venn diagram, geographic heatmap
  - Metrics: "Correlated data from N authorities" where N = actual count at time of writing. Do not claim future data sources. Ensure claims match actual run outputs.
  - JSON-LD structured data

### Phase 3 — Integration
- Link from `energy.html` marine safety section
- Add to `case-studies/index.html` grid

### Dependencies
- Blocked by WRK-074 (complete marine safety importers) for full "10+ authorities" claim
- Can start with 3 working sources (USCG, NTSB, ATSB) for initial case study

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MINOR | Gemini: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - Added explicit scope definition: US waters, 2010-2023, specific sources
  - Enforced constraint: case study text must state actual N authorities, not future claims
  - Added de-duplication rate calculation method requirement
  - Added reproducibility requirement: document exact query parameters
  - Added Codex feedback: ensure all claims match actual run outputs
