# AQWA Diffraction Analysis Runner

## What
Add the ability to run AQWA diffraction analysis from digitalmodel. This includes invoking AQWA solvers, managing license checks, and handling execution lifecycle (pre/post hooks).

## Why
Diffraction analysis is a core hydrodynamic capability. AQWA is a widely-used tool for computing wave loads, RAOs, and motion responses. Automating the run process reduces manual effort and ensures repeatability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] AQWA solver invocation with configurable parameters
- [x] License/environment validation before run
- [x] Run status tracking (queued, running, completed, failed)
- [x] Log capture and error reporting
- [x] Integration with batch analysis pipeline (WRK-027)

## Deliverables
- `aqwa_runner.py` — AQWARunner with prepare/execute/run pipeline, AQWARunConfig, AQWARunResult, AQWARunStatus
- `test_aqwa_runner.py` — 37 tests (all passed), 8 test classes
- CLI command: `run-aqwa`
- Registered in `__init__.py` exports
