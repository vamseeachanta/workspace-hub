# Calibrate Well Planning Risk Probabilities — BSEE/HSE Data

## Why

`WELL_PLANNING_RISKS` (WRK-163) has hard-coded `probability` values. BSEE HSE incident
data and BSEE inspection records contain empirical frequencies for drilling-related events
(kicks, stuck pipe, BOP failures, lost circulation). Calibrating probability values against
this data makes the risk framework defensible and data-driven.

## What

- Load BSEE HSE incident data from existing `hse` module
- Map incident types to `WellPlanningRisk.category` taxonomy
- Compute empirical frequencies per category per year
- Add `RiskCalibrator.calibrate(hse_df)` that updates probability fields
- Produce calibration report: events/year, confidence by category

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `RiskCalibrator.calibrate(hse_df)` updates risk probabilities in-place
- [ ] Calibration covers at least 5 risk categories
- [ ] Calibration report DataFrame with category, events_per_year, confidence
- [ ] Original registry usable as baseline when no data provided
- [ ] 20+ tests
