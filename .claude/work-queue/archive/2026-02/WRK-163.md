# Well Planning Risk Empowerment Framework

## User Voice (Drilling Engineer)

> I am a drilling engineer, responsible for updating the risk matrix. Writing those risks are difficult, not because I don't understand the risk of well operations, but because I don't see how a project team are going to act on them.
>
> Say we have a technical challenge where I need a better downhole tool, I know that the project I'm working on is not empowered with influence over contracts.
>
> Or say we see a need for a rig with specific capacities, I also know that the rig selection happens without impact from my project.
>
> So I end up writing risks that are more operational, like drilling in swelling clay can be difficult.
>
> How are well planning projects empowered to handle risk?

## Problem Statement

Current risk matrices in well planning suffer from an **actionability gap**:

1. **Strategic risks** (downhole tool selection, rig capacity requirements, contract terms) are real and understood by the drilling engineer, but the well planning project has no authority to mitigate them — those decisions sit with procurement, fleet management, or corporate.
2. **Operational risks** (swelling clay, lost circulation, wellbore instability) are what engineers default to writing, because those fall within the project's sphere of control.
3. The result is a **systematically incomplete risk register** that captures what the project *can* do, not what it *should* do.

## What

A risk classification framework that explicitly models **project authority boundaries** and connects risks to the organizational lever required to mitigate them. Three risk tiers:

| Tier | Scope | Authority | Example |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Operational** | Within project execution | Drilling team | Swelling clay, mud weight, BOP testing |
| **Tactical** | Requires cross-functional input | Project manager + functional leads | Rig-specific procedures, casing design changes, logistics |
| **Strategic** | Outside project authority | Corporate / procurement / fleet | Downhole tool contracts, rig selection, regulatory changes |

### Key Features

1. **Risk ownership tagging** — each risk tagged with the organizational function that holds the mitigation lever (project, procurement, fleet, regulatory, corporate)
2. **Escalation pathway** — strategic risks auto-flagged for escalation with a structured request template ("We need X capability because Y risk, the lever is Z")
3. **Risk influence map** — visualization showing which risks the project controls vs. influences vs. observes
4. **Actionable risk language** — templates that convert "we need a better tool" into "Request: evaluate downhole tool alternatives for [formation], current tool limitation: [gap], risk if unaddressed: [consequence], decision owner: [function]"
5. **Rig capability matching** — link to rig fleet data (WRK-104/135) to quantify the gap between required and available rig capacities
6. **MPD as strategic risk mitigation** — MPD capability changes which risks are manageable at the operational tier vs. requiring strategic escalation. A well that requires MPD but is assigned a non-MPD rig is a strategic risk (fleet/procurement lever). A well on an MPD-equipped rig can manage narrow pressure windows operationally. The risk framework should tag MPD availability as a rig capability factor that shifts risks between tiers. Link to WRK-168 (MPD systems module) for system data.

### Data Model Sketch

```python
class RiskAuthority(Enum):
    PROJECT = "project"           # drilling team can mitigate directly
    CROSS_FUNCTIONAL = "cross"    # needs coordination with other disciplines
    PROCUREMENT = "procurement"   # contract / vendor decision
    FLEET = "fleet"               # rig selection / scheduling
    REGULATORY = "regulatory"     # government / classification society
    CORPORATE = "corporate"       # policy / budget / strategy

class WellPlanningRisk:
    id: str
    description: str                  # plain language risk
    severity: Severity
    likelihood: Likelihood
    risk_tier: str                    # operational / tactical / strategic
    authority: RiskAuthority          # who holds the mitigation lever
    mitigation_action: str            # what needs to happen
    decision_owner: str               # role/function that decides
    escalation_required: bool         # True if outside project scope
    escalation_template: str | None   # structured request if escalated
    linked_capability: str | None     # e.g., "rig_fleet.hookload >= 1000t"
```

## Reference: Offshore Construction Vessel Authority Map

**Asset**: `assets/WRK-163/construction_vessel_who_is_who.jpeg`

This infographic illustrates the organizational authority structure on an offshore construction vessel — "both a ship and a construction site." It maps directly to the 3-tier risk model:

### 4 External Stakeholders (Strategic Tier)

| # | Role | Authority | Risk Lever |
|---|------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | **Client / Operator Representative** | Approves scope, accepts work | Project scope, acceptance criteria |
| 2 | **Contractor** | Runs the offshore construction work | Execution method, resources, schedule |
| 3 | **Vessel Owner / Ship Management** | Owns/operates ship systems and marine crew | Vessel capability, marine crew competence |
| 4 | **Marine Warranty** | Independent assurance; verifies critical operations acceptance | Go/no-go on critical lifts, tows, installations |

### Inner Ring — Ship Side / Marine Operations (Operational Tier)

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| Captain / Master | Ultimate safety authority; **veto right** |
| Bridge Officers | Navigation, watchkeeping |
| DP Operators | Dynamic positioning control |
| Engine Room / Technical Crew | Engines, thrusters, power |
| HSE / Safety | Ship safety routines, coordination |
| Catering / Hotel Crew | Galley, accommodation, logistics onboard |

### Inner Ring — Construction Side / Offshore Project Execution (Tactical + Operational Tiers)

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| Offshore Construction Manager (OCM) | Leads construction site onboard |
| Superintendent / Shift Supervisor | Shift execution and coordination |
| Project Engineer / Planning Engineer | Task plans, sequencing, readiness |
| Analysis / Specialist Engineer | Supports complex operations when required |
| Deck Foreman | Orchestrates deck execution; directs riggers |
| Riggers | Hands-on deck work, rigging, fastening, hook-up |
| Crane Operator | Controls main lift operations |
| ROV Team | Subsea connections, cutting, inspection, "handshakes" |
| Survey Team | Positioning/transponders; where things are in 2D/3D |

### Key Observations for Risk Framework

- **Captain has veto right** — ultimate safety authority overrides both Client Rep and Contractor. This is a strategic risk lever held by the vessel side, not the project.
- **Marine Warranty** checks and accepts critical operations and procedures independently — another external authority gate that the project team must navigate, not control.
- **Ship vs. Construction Site** duality means two parallel chains of command on the same vessel: marine ops (navigation, DP, engines, hotel) vs. construction ops (mission equipment, deck, subsea). A risk that crosses this boundary (e.g., DP upset during crane lift) involves both chains.
- **Operational reality notes**: "No operation is worth an injury" (safety-first culture), 12h on / 12h off construction crew rotations, DP watch may be 6/6 with frequent rotations, "High day rates — efficiency matters."

This structure should inform the `RiskAuthority` enum and escalation pathways — particularly for offshore construction risks where the drilling engineer equivalent is the **Project Engineer / Planning Engineer**, who can see risks in rigging, lifting, and subsea operations but doesn't control the vessel, the contract, or the marine warranty approval.

## Why

- **GTM value**: This is a pain point every drilling engineer recognizes. A tool that explicitly handles "risks I can see but can't fix" differentiates from generic risk matrices.
- **Data linkage**: Connects to existing rig fleet inventory (WRK-104/135), drilling cost data (WRK-019), and HSE risk index (WRK-014/162).
- **Consulting deliverable**: The empowerment framework itself is a consulting output — helps operators restructure how well planning teams interact with corporate functions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Risk authority taxonomy defined (enum + descriptions)
- [ ] WellPlanningRisk data model implemented with tier classification
- [ ] Escalation template generator for strategic risks
- [ ] Risk influence map visualization (project controls / influences / observes)
- [ ] Integration with existing `risk-assessment` skill (5x5 matrix + authority tagging)
- [ ] Test suite with realistic well planning scenarios (deepwater, ERD, HPHT)
- [ ] Example risk register output showing all three tiers populated
- [ ] At least one scenario demonstrating MPD as a tier-shifting capability (strategic risk → operational risk when MPD available)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Well planning risk framework with organisational authority mapping is a knowledge management and project governance tool — moderate ecosystem value for project teams.
- Risk classification and authority boundary frameworks will benefit from improved reasoning models in 3–4 months; the framework design still needs domain expertise.
- **Disposition: groundwork now, park rest** — define the taxonomy and authority tiers now (fast, high-leverage); defer the full implementation to when better reasoning agents can populate and maintain the framework.
