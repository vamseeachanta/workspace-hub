# acma-projects Repo Content Index — Catalog Projects and Reference Docs

## Problem

`acma-projects/README.md` has only a link to ACMA's website and a partial copy-paste of
their structural analysis services description. The repo contains:
- Multiple projects (B1512, B1516, B1522, B1535, B1535-1, B1912)
- Admin docs (onboarding, tools, OrcaFlex, codes & standards)
- Calculations folder
- AI/agent tooling configs (agent-os, .hive-mind)

There is no index of what the projects are, what analysis was done, or what reference
docs exist. `admin/codes_and_standards.md` is a potentially high-value file for the CP
stream (WRK-269) but it's completely undiscoverable.

## What

Create `acma-projects/CONTENT_INDEX.md` — a structured catalog.

### Structure

```markdown
# acma-projects Content Index

## Repo Purpose
[What this repo is: ACMA client project archive + reference docs]

## Projects

| Project | Folder | Scope | Key Docs |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|

## Reference Docs
| Doc | Path | Relevance |

## Admin
[Brief — tools, OrcaFlex license, onboarding docs]

## Search Tips
```

## Scope to Catalog

- **Projects**: For each Bxxxx folder — what is the project (vessel type, client, analysis type)?
  Read `scope.md` if exists; otherwise infer from folder structure.
- **Admin**: Summarize key reference docs: `codes_and_standards.md`, `licensed_software_review.md`,
  `orcaflex/`, `timesheet/` (brief)
- **Calculations**: What types of calculations are in there?
- **Agent tooling**: `.agent-os/` — note the framework used (old agent-os vs workspace-hub pattern)

## Special Value: codes_and_standards.md

`admin/codes_and_standards.md` likely contains a list of standards used for ACMA projects.
This may be directly relevant to WRK-269 (CP standards research). Index this file prominently
and note any CP-relevant standards it references.

## Legal Caution

Project folders (B1512, B1516, etc.) contain client project data. The index should describe
project type/scope at a high level only — no client names, no proprietary deliverable details.
Use generic descriptions: "offshore structural analysis", "vessel RAO study", etc.

## Why

- `admin/codes_and_standards.md` is a potentially valuable CP standards reference (WRK-269)
- Project patterns in each Bxxxx folder may contain reusable analysis templates
- Currently completely undiscoverable — every session starts from zero

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `acma-projects/CONTENT_INDEX.md` created
- [ ] Each project folder (B1512, B1516, B1522, B1535, B1535-1, B1912) summarized with type + scope
- [ ] `admin/codes_and_standards.md` flagged in index with note on CP-relevance
- [ ] Legal check: no specific client names or project details in index description
- [ ] Quick Nav table makes it <30s to locate any project or admin doc

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Pure cataloging task, no code, no tests
- High session value: every future session that needs ACMA reference data benefits
- **Disposition: do now, Route A**
