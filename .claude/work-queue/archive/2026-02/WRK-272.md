# CP Capability Extension — DNV-RP-B401 Offshore Platform + DNV-RP-F103 2016

## What

Extend the `CathodicProtection` class with two new calculation routes:

1. **DNV-RP-B401 offshore fixed platform SACP** — the primary offshore engineering use case
   not yet implemented. DNV-RP-B401 (currently 2011 in-repo; 2021 edition to be confirmed
   by WRK-269) covers jacket structures, gravity-based structures, and subsea equipment.

2. **DNV-RP-F103 2016 update** — if WRK-269 confirms material differences from the 2010
   edition currently implemented. The Saipem Yellowtail project used the 2016 edition;
   key areas to check: wet storage period handling, stand-off anode calculations, FLET/PLET
   protection clauses.

**Blocked by WRK-269** — scope of this item depends on what the standards research confirms.
WRK-269 will determine:
- Whether DNV-RP-B401 2021 significantly changes the 2011 calculation method
- Whether DNV-RP-F103 2016 changes are material or cosmetic relative to 2010
- Which editions we can validate against

## Why

Current code covers submarine pipelines (DNV-RP-F103) and ships (ABS). Offshore fixed
platforms are the highest-value A&CE use case — jacket structures, jackets with anodes,
topsides — and have no implementation. This is the core of offshore CP engineering.

WRK-206 (archived) noted the gap: "current engineering skills cover cathodic-protection
(prevention)" but flagged that the skill and FFS are the prevention/damage pair. The
offshore platform route completes the prevention side.

## Scope (to be refined after WRK-269)

### Route 1: DNV-RP-B401 Offshore Fixed Platform

New method `DNV_RP_B401_offshore_platform(cfg)` in `CathodicProtection`:
- Structure types: jacket (tubular members + nodes), gravity-based, topsides steel
- Anode types: flush-mounted, stand-off, bracelet (where applicable)
- Environmental zones: submerged, splash, atmospheric (different current densities per zone)
- Seawater temperature correction (tropical vs North Sea vs Arctic)
- Design outputs: anode mass, anode count, spacing, current distribution check

### Route 2: DNV-RP-F103 2016 (if materially different from 2010)

If WRK-269 confirms material differences:
- Update `DNV_RP_F103_2010` method or add `DNV_RP_F103_2016` route
- Document exact equation changes in code comments with edition references
- Add migration note to SKILL.md

### Optional: Basic ICCP Framework

If time allows and WRK-269 identifies a supported standard for ICCP:
- Transformer-rectifier sizing (basic)
- Impressed current anode groundbed resistance
- This is lower priority than SACP offshore platform

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WRK-269 completed and go/no-go recommendation received before starting
- [ ] DNV-RP-B401 offshore platform route implemented with router key `DNV_RP_B401_offshore`
- [ ] Environmental zone handling: submerged / splash / atmospheric current densities
- [ ] Temperature correction factors applied per standard
- [ ] Anode geometry types: flush-mounted and stand-off at minimum
- [ ] 10+ unit tests covering offshore platform route
- [ ] DNV-RP-F103 2016 assessment completed — either updated or documented as unchanged
- [ ] SKILL.md updated with new routes and examples
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Offshore platform CP is the highest-value capability gap — the core A&CE market
- Route C complexity: new standard, new structure types, non-trivial engineering calculations
- **Disposition: invest — blocked by WRK-269; scope confirmed before implementation**
