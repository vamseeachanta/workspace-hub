# Scale Hull Panel Meshes to Target Principal Dimensions

## What
Build a hull scaling pipeline that takes a cataloged hull panel mesh (from WRK-114) and scales it to match target principal dimensions (length, beam, draft) for use in diffraction/hydrodynamic analysis. Support both geometric (uniform) and parametric (non-uniform) scaling approaches.

## Why
The hull library contains representative meshes at fixed dimensions. Real analysis requires meshes at project-specific dimensions. Rather than re-creating geometry from scratch, scaling existing panels to target L/B/D ratios is the industry-standard rapid workflow. This directly enables the parametric hull pipeline (WRK-043) and solver benchmarking (WRK-031).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Scaling function that takes a PanelMesh + target L/B/D and returns a scaled PanelMesh
- [x] Geometric (uniform) scaling: single scale factor applied to all vertices
- [x] Parametric (non-uniform) scaling: independent X/Y/Z scale factors from L/B/D ratios
- [x] Preserve panel topology (connectivity unchanged, only vertex positions scaled)
- [x] Output scaled mesh as GDF file ready for diffraction solvers
- [x] Validate scaled mesh: no degenerate panels, correct bounding box, normals consistent
- [ ] Integration with hull catalog: select source hull by hull_id, scale to target, export (deferred — catalog lookup convenience function)
- [x] Tests covering both scaling modes, edge cases, and round-trip verification

## Results
- **Commit**: `14e1503a8` (digitalmodel)
- **New**: `mesh_scaler.py` (~240 lines) — 3 scaling functions + validation + GDF export
- **New**: `test_mesh_scaler.py` (~290 lines) — 34 tests across 6 classes
- **Exports**: ScaleDimensions, ScaleResult, scale_mesh_uniform, scale_mesh_parametric, scale_mesh_to_target, validate_scaled_mesh, export_scaled_gdf
- **All tests passing**: 34/34
- **Deferred**: CLI interface and catalog-lookup integration (Phase 3 convenience features)
