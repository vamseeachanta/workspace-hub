# Refine and Coarsen Hull Panel Meshes for Mesh Convergence Sensitivity

## What
Build mesh refinement and coarsening tools for convergence studies in hydrodynamic diffraction analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Mesh refinement: subdivide each quad panel into 4 sub-panels with interpolated vertices
- [x] Mesh coarsening: merge adjacent panels (wraps existing coarsen_mesh)
- [x] Generate mesh family from single source (0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x panel density)
- [x] Preserve hull geometry fidelity: bounding box preserved after refinement
- [x] Output each mesh variant as GDF file with descriptive naming
- [x] Mesh quality metrics: aspect ratio, min/max panel area per variant
- [x] Convergence report template: markdown table of mesh variants
- [x] Tests covering refinement, coarsening, quality metrics, and GDF output

## Results
- **Commit**: `a57109dc0` (digitalmodel)
- **New**: `mesh_refiner.py` (272 lines) — refine_mesh, compute_quality_metrics, generate_mesh_family, export_mesh_family, convergence_summary
- **New**: `test_mesh_refiner.py` — 32 tests across 6 classes
- **Exports**: MeshQualityMetrics, MeshFamilyMember, refine_mesh, compute_quality_metrics, generate_mesh_family, export_mesh_family, convergence_summary
- **All tests passing**: 32/32 (106/106 total hull_library)
- **Deferred**: Phase 4 convergence study script (requires OrcaWave license)
