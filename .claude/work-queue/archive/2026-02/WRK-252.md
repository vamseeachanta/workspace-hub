# worldenergydata module discoverability review — regenerate after new data source modules

## What
Re-run the worldenergydata module discoverability review (originally WRK-096) now that significant new modules have been added: NCS/WRK-190, Brazil ANP/WRK-194, adapters/WRK-018. Generate a machine-readable module manifest. Fold into the skills knowledge graph.

## Why
The original discoverability improvements are outdated — new modules added since WRK-096 are not indexed or discoverable by agents.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Updated module index covering all data source modules including NCS, Brazil ANP, BSEE, OSHA, PHMSA, LNG, and marine safety
- [ ] Machine-readable manifest generated at `worldenergydata/module-manifest.yaml`
- [ ] Linked to skills knowledge graph (WRK-205)
- [ ] Agents can query "available data sources by region/type"

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Prerequisite for autonomous data analysis — agents cannot use modules they cannot discover
- Low effort, generates from existing code; the WRK-252 manifest will also inform WRK-247 (digitalmodel manifest) approach
- **Disposition: invest now** — low effort, high discoverability value, prerequisite for autonomous data workflows
