# AQWA Batch Analysis Execution

## What
Enable batch execution of multiple AQWA runs. Support running parametric sweeps, multiple wave headings, or multiple hull configurations in a single batch command with job queuing and parallel execution where possible.

## Why
Diffraction analysis often requires hundreds of runs across wave periods, headings, and loading conditions. Batch execution automates this, tracks progress, and handles failures gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Batch job definition (list of runs with parameters)
- [x] Sequential and parallel execution modes
- [x] Progress tracking and status reporting
- [x] Failure handling with retry logic
- [x] Results collection and organization per batch
- [x] Integration with AQWA runner (WRK-025)

## Deliverables
- `aqwa_batch_runner.py` — AQWABatchRunner with sequential/parallel modes, AQWABatchConfig, AQWABatchJobConfig, AQWABatchReport
- `test_aqwa_batch_runner.py` — 18 tests (all passed)
- CLI command: `batch-aqwa`
- Registered in `__init__.py` exports
