# Work Queue Workflow Gate Enforcement

## What
The work queue workflow has unenforced gates that allow items to slip through
incorrectly. Three violations were caught in session 2026-02-18:

1. `plan_reviewed: true` was set without actual cross-review happening
2. A Route C (complex) item had an inline plan instead of a spec in `specs/wrk/WRK-NNN/`
3. Item moved to `working/` before `plan_reviewed` was confirmed

## Why
Without enforcement, the workflow degrades to best-effort — the same gates that
prevent wasted implementation effort get skipped under time pressure.
The fix is lightweight checks, not a full rewrite.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `work.sh` (or SKILL.md process) validates `plan_reviewed: true` before
      allowing `status: working` transition for Route B/C items *(already in workflow-guards.sh)*
- [x] Route C items: warn/block if `spec_ref` is empty when moving to working *(added to workflow-guards.sh 2026-02-18)*
- [x] `plan_reviewed` field: document that it must only be set AFTER Codex/Gemini
      verdict is received (not at plan creation time) *(SKILL.md pre-flight checklist 2026-02-18)*
- [x] Add pre-flight checklist to SKILL.md Phase 2 (Process) covering these gates *(done 2026-02-18)*
- [x] Correct WRK-118: create spec stub in `specs/wrk/WRK-118/` and link via spec_ref *(done 2026-02-18)*
