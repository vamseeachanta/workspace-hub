# Get OrcaFlex framework of agreement and terms

## What
Obtain the OrcaFlex framework of agreement and licensing terms from Orcina.

## Why
Required for procurement/admin records — understanding the licensing framework, terms of use, and agreement structure for OrcaFlex software.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OrcaFlex framework of agreement obtained
- [ ] Licensing terms documented/filed in aceengineer-admin

## Plan

- **Step 1**: Contact Orcina sales (sales@orcina.com) requesting framework agreement template and current licensing terms
- **Step 2**: Review agreement for: license types (node-locked vs floating), annual fees, maintenance terms, multi-seat options
- **Step 3**: File agreement document in `aceengineer-admin/contracts/software/orcaflex/`
- **Step 4**: Document key terms summary in a README alongside the agreement
- **Verify**: Confirm agreement covers OrcaFlex + OrcaWave + OrcFxAPI Python bindings

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: APPROVE | Codex: MINOR | Gemini: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - No plan changes required (simple procurement/admin task)
  - Codex suggested adding owner and timeline — this is tracked externally in work queue metadata
  - NDA consideration noted: verify if NDA is needed before sharing agreement details
