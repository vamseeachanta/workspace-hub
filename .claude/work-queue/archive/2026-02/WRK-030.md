# OrcaWave Batch Analysis + Postprocessing

## What
Enable batch execution of OrcaWave runs and build a postprocessing pipeline. Extract RAOs, generate verification plots, and produce insight reports. Mirror the AQWA batch/postprocessing capabilities for consistency.

## Why
Same rationale as AQWA batch/postprocessing — diffraction analysis requires many runs and structured results extraction. Consistent interfaces between AQWA and OrcaWave postprocessing enable the benchmark comparison (WRK-031).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Batch job definition and execution for OrcaWave
- [x] Sequential and parallel execution modes
- [x] Parse OrcaWave output files
- [x] Extract RAOs for all 6 DOFs
- [x] Generate RAO plots (amplitude + phase)
- [x] Verification checks (symmetry, limits, resonance)
- [x] Summary report with key insights
- [x] Export to standard formats (CSV, Polars DataFrame)
- [x] Consistent output format with AQWA postprocessing for benchmarking

## Deliverables
- `result_extractor.py` — Bridge RunResult → DiffractionResults via OrcaWaveConverter
- `orcawave_batch_runner.py` — Batch orchestrator (sequential/parallel, YAML config, reporting)
- `rao_plotter.py` — Interactive Plotly HTML plots (amplitude, phase, combined 6-DOF)
- `polars_exporter.py` — Polars/Pandas DataFrame export + CSV (long format)
- `_validate_resonance()` added to OutputValidator (sharp peaks, excessive amplification)
- CLI commands: `batch-orcawave`, `plot-raos`
- 63 tests (54 passed, 9 skipped — polars not installed), 90.35% coverage
