# ENIGMA safety analysis skill — register as agent-callable capability

## What
Register the ENIGMA technical safety analysis module as an agent-callable skill. Pair with the HSE risk index (WRK-198) and marine safety data (WRK-074) to create an automated safety assessment workflow for project briefings.

## Why
ENIGMA-based safety analysis was implemented (WRK-072) but has no skill wrapper and is invisible to agents. With improved reasoning agents, ENIGMA + live HSE data = automated safety assessment narratives.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skill registered in `.claude/skills/eng/`
- [ ] Callable from a marine or pipeline project context
- [ ] Outputs fault propagation summary and risk rating
- [ ] Paired with HSE risk index for data-driven ratings
- [ ] Tested with 2 case types (marine and pipeline)

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Emerging area where improved reasoning models add significant value — ENIGMA analysis with live data is an ideal agent task
- Foundation work (ENIGMA module, HSE index, marine data) is all complete; registration and pairing is the gap
- **Disposition: invest now** (foundation); plan for model-augmented narrative generation in 3 months when reasoning models improve further
