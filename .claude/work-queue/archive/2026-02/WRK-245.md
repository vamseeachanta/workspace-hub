# Fatigue assessment skill — wrap full module with input schema and auto export

## What
Create a "fatigue assessment skill" wrapping the full fatigue module (676 tests, all phases complete). Document the input schema, S-N curve selection logic, and expected output. Wire into multi-format export (WRK-242) for auto-generated PDF/Excel client reports.

## Why
The fatigue module is the most comprehensive engineering deliverable in the codebase (676 tests, 5 phases) but has no agent-callable skill wrapper with documented I/O contract.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skill registered in `.claude/skills/eng/`
- [ ] Input schema documented (load history, S-N curve selection, design code)
- [ ] Output includes utilisation ratios, life estimates, and governing load case
- [ ] Auto-export to PDF/Excel via WRK-242 wired in
- [ ] Tested end-to-end with a representative fatigue input

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Highest-leverage engineering skill in the ecosystem — 676 tests, 5 phases complete, yet no agent can invoke it
- Module is done; wrapper is minimal effort with outsized impact on agent capability
- **Disposition: invest now** — module is done, wrapper is the gap; this is the most impactful single registration in this batch
