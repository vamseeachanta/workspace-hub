# Migrate raw ABS docs into structured ABS/ folder

## What

`/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/raw/0000 Codes & Standards/ABS/` contains unprocessed ABS documents
(sub-folders ABS 00, 002, 057, 101, 104, 115, 123 and loose PDFs). These predate the structured
archive and need migrating to `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/ABS/`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All ABS docs from raw/ moved to ABS/Guidance-Notes/ or ABS/Rules/ as appropriate
- [ ] INDEX.md updated with every new file
- [ ] raw/ABS/ folder empty after migration
