# WRK-211: Ecosystem Health Check Skill — Parallel Agent

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `SKILL.md` created at `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/ecosystem-health/SKILL.md`
- [x] Health check suite documented with pass/fail conditions (14 checks across 4 groups)
- [x] Invocation pattern defined: parallel agent (Task tool with `subagent_type=Bash`)
- [x] Output format: structured summary table + JSON signal for `/improve`
- [x] `/repo-sync` skill updated: Phase 5 spawns ecosystem health agent
- [ ] Stop hook (`ecosystem-health-check.sh`) updated to reference skill — deferred to WRK-208 remaining work
