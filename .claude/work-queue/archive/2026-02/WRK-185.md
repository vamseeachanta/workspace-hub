# WRK-185: Ecosystem Truth Review - centralization status

## What
Capture the factual state of whether agent instructions, skills, and work items are centrally managed from workspace-hub, and define concrete remediation steps to eliminate drift.

## Why
Current assumptions and actual filesystem/tooling behavior diverge. We need a single auditable work item that records:
- what is truly centralized today,
- what is only partially centralized,
- and what must be changed to reach strict workspace-hub control.

## Findings Captured (from review)
1. **Instructions are only partially centralized**:
- Canonical `AGENTS.md` exists in workspace-hub.
- Pilot repos have generated adapters, but full validation still fails across the ecosystem.
- Evidence: `scripts/operations/compliance/validate_agent_contract.sh` reported 54 issues.

2. **Skills are mixed (not symlink-only)**:
- Many repo `.claude/skills` entries are symlinks for `guidelines/meta/workflows`.
- But many repo skill files are real local files/directories (non-symlink), including large local catalogs.
- Propagation scripts use `cp -r` in multiple places.

3. **Work-items are mostly centralized but not clean**:
- Canonical queue is `.claude/work-queue/`.
- Repo-local WRK files still exist (e.g., `digitalmodel/.claude/work-queue/pending/WRK-066.md`, `WRK-106.md`).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A written decision is recorded for strict skills strategy: symlink-only vs allowed local exceptions.
- [ ] A full ecosystem adapter generation + validation pass is run and archived.
- [ ] Repo-local WRK files are either migrated to root queue or explicitly ignored by policy.
- [ ] A remediation script/plan is attached that maps each finding to owner + command.
- [ ] `spec_ref` document is created and cross-reviewed.

## Plan
1. Build `specs/wrk/WRK-185/ecosystem-centralization-review.md` with evidence and decisions.
2. Run full contract rollout:
   - `scripts/operations/compliance/generate_agent_adapters.sh`
   - `scripts/operations/compliance/validate_agent_contract.sh`
3. Add skills audit report (symlink vs real files) and decide target policy.
4. Implement chosen skills policy in propagation scripts (enforced behavior).
5. Close repo-local WRK drift by migration or policy-exception list.

## Progress Update (2026-02-17)
- [x] Created route-C spec: `specs/wrk/WRK-185/ecosystem-centralization-review.md`
- [x] Implemented governance scripts:
  - `scripts/operations/compliance/validate_work_queue_schema.sh`
  - `scripts/operations/compliance/audit_wrk_location.sh`
  - `scripts/operations/compliance/audit_skill_symlink_policy.sh`
  - `scripts/operations/compliance/check_governance.sh`
- [x] Wired governance checks into CI warn/gate flow in `.github/workflows/baseline-check.yml`
- [x] Wired governance commands into workspace CLI: `scripts/workspace`
- [x] Verified WRK location false-positive exclusion for `*/scripts/review/results/*`
- [x] Added execution guard: `medium|complex|high` work now requires `plan_reviewed: true` before `execute`
- [x] Skills link-only policy now passes audit across child repos (`issue_count=0`)
- [x] Revalidated WRK location policy: no current misplaced `WRK-*.md` outside `.claude/work-queue/`
- [x] Normalized active WRK metadata + status placement (`normalize_work_queue_metadata.sh --mode apply --relocate true`)
- [x] Governance gate passes for changed scope (`check_governance.sh --mode gate --scope changed`)
- [ ] Resolve cross-review `REQUEST_CHANGES` findings in WRK-185 spec

## Execution Brief
### Provider
- Primary: Codex (script + filesystem truthing)
- Secondary: Claude (policy and cross-repo documentation alignment)

### Reviewer Checklist
- Validate all commands are reproducible.
- Verify findings map to concrete file paths and scripts.
- Confirm no policy claims without corresponding enforcement.
