# CP Capability — ABS GN Offshore Structures 2018 Route

## What

Implement `ABS_gn_offshore_2018` as a new route in `CathodicProtection().router(cfg)`.
This is the ABS equivalent of DNV-RP-B401 — covering jacket structures, semi-submersibles,
FPSOs, and other offshore installations classed under ABS.

The guide PDF is already in-repo:
`digitalmodel/docs/domains/cathodic_protection/codes/ABS cathodic-protection-offshore-gn-dec18.pdf`

## Why Separate from WRK-272

WRK-272 implements DNV-RP-B401 (offshore platform route) and DNV-RP-F103 2016 (pipeline
update). ABS GN Offshore Structures is a parallel standard — same structure types, different
methodology and current density tables. It is not a subset of B401; it requires its own
calculation route and test coverage.

Use case: a client with an ABS-classed jacket (e.g. Gulf of Mexico shallow water) would
use this route rather than DNV-RP-B401.

## Scope

### Standard Reference
- **ABS Guidance Notes on Cathodic Protection of Offshore Structures** (Dec 2018, Guide No. 306)
- PDF: `digitalmodel/docs/domains/cathodic_protection/codes/ABS cathodic-protection-offshore-gn-dec18.pdf`

### Contrast with ABS GN Ships (already implemented)
- ABS GN Ships 2017: Ship hulls — flush/bracelet anodes, hull geometry, ABS Table 1 current densities
- ABS GN Offshore 2018: Offshore structures — jacket members, anodes attached to structure,
  splash zone considerations, mudline protection, ABS Section 3 current density tables

### New Route Inputs
- Structure type: jacket, semi-sub, FPSO hull, fixed platform
- Water zone breakdown: atmospheric, splash, immersion, mudline/buried
- Anode geometry: stand-off bracelet, flush bracket-mounted
- Coating: offshore epoxy systems, TSA coatings
- Current densities per ABS GN Offshore 2018 Table 3-1/3-2 (differ from Ships standard)
- Design life: typical 20–25 years for fixed platforms

### Implementation Location
`digitalmodel/src/digitalmodel/infrastructure/common/cathodic_protection.py` — add:
- `ABS_gn_offshore_2018(cfg)` method
- Supporting private methods `_abs_offshore_*` following existing naming convention

## Test Requirements

- Minimum 3 test functions covering:
  1. Jacket structure — standard 25-year immersion zone
  2. Splash zone — higher current density requirements
  3. Buried mudline anode — lower current density conditions
- Validate against ABS GN Offshore 2018 worked example (if present in the PDF)
- Follow TDD: tests written first, then implementation

## Dependencies

- **WRK-269** (standards research) must confirm: does ABS GN Offshore 2018 methodology
  differ significantly from 2016 or earlier editions? If not, simpler to implement directly.
- **WRK-276** (calc abstraction) — no direct block, but if any abstracted calc uses this
  standard it becomes a test input

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `ABS_gn_offshore_2018(cfg)` method implemented in `cathodic_protection.py`
- [ ] Route registered in `router()` under `calculation_type: "ABS_gn_offshore_2018"`
- [ ] Supporting private methods follow `_abs_offshore_*` naming pattern
- [ ] Minimum 3 test functions; all passing: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests/specialized/cathodic_protection/ -v`
- [ ] At least one test validated against ABS GN Offshore 2018 source values
- [ ] SKILL.md updated to list new route in capabilities (bump to v1.2.0)
- [ ] Legal scan passes: no client identifiers in new code

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Completes the ABS coverage: ships (done) + offshore structures (this WRK)
- Paired with WRK-272 (DNV-RP-B401), gives us dual-standard coverage for all offshore platform types
- **Disposition: Route C — plan gate required before implementation**
