# API RP 2RD + API STD 2RD riser wall thickness — WSD & LRFD combined loading

## What
Implement both API RP 2RD (legacy WSD) and API STD 2RD (current LRFD) riser wall thickness and combined loading checks as new design code strategies alongside the existing API RP 1111 implementation.

## Why
- **API RP 2RD** (legacy): Many existing risers were designed and still comply under the old working stress design (WSD) standard. Need this for re-qualification, brownfield modifications, and projects where the operator's governing design basis references the RP edition.
- **API STD 2RD** (current): The replacement standard using LRFD methodology with 4 combined loading interaction methods. Required for new riser designs.
- Having both codes plus API RP 1111 enables cross-code comparison for different pipe applications (pipelines vs risers, legacy vs current).

## Context
From WRK-044 session research:

### API STD 2RD Key Differences from API RP 1111
| Aspect | API RP 1111 | API STD 2RD |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Scope | Pipelines | Risers (floating production) |
| Method | WSD (working stress) | LRFD (load-resistance factor) |
| Combined check | Single Von Mises | 4 methods (Eq 5.3-3 to 5.3-6) |
| Factors | Design factor f_d on resistance | Separate load (γ_f) and resistance (γ_m) factors |
| Conditions | Operating/Installation/Extreme/Survival | Operating/Extreme/Survival/ALS |

### 4 Combined Loading Methods (API STD 2RD Section 5.3)
1. **Eq 5.3-3**: Von Mises equivalent stress ≤ f_y/γ_m (like API 1111 but LRFD)
2. **Eq 5.3-4**: DNV-style interaction (pressure + moment + tension combined)
3. **Eq 5.3-5**: Axial-bending interaction with lateral pressure
4. **Eq 5.3-6**: Simplified interaction for preliminary design

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API RP 2RD strategy class registered in CODE_REGISTRY (WSD method)
- [ ] API STD 2RD strategy class registered in CODE_REGISTRY (LRFD method)
- [ ] Both support code revision/edition specification (see WRK-145)
- [ ] WSD factors for API RP 2RD as configurable data structure
- [ ] LRFD load factors and resistance factors for API STD 2RD as configurable data structure
- [ ] At least Eq 5.3-3 (Von Mises LRFD) implemented with M-T interaction support
- [ ] Capacity limits and envelopes generated for both code conditions
- [ ] HTML report sections for both codes (can extend existing report or separate)
- [ ] Comparison table: API RP 1111 vs API RP 2RD vs API STD 2RD for same pipe
- [ ] Tests with known reference values
- [ ] Structural analysis skill file updated

## Plan
### Phase 1 — Research
- Deep-read API RP 2RD (legacy WSD) combined loading equations
- Deep-read API STD 2RD Section 5 (strength design) LRFD equations
- Identify load factor tables and resistance factor tables for both
- Map to existing `DesignCode`, `DesignFactors`, `DesignLoads` data structures

### Phase 2a — API RP 2RD (Legacy WSD)
- `wall_thickness_codes.py`: Add `API_RP_2RD_Strategy` class
- WSD Von Mises combined check with RP 2RD design factors
- Define `API_RP_2RD_CONDITIONS` with WSD factors
- Wire into M-T report generation

### Phase 2b — API STD 2RD (Current LRFD)
- `wall_thickness_codes.py`: Add `API_STD_2RD_Strategy` class
- Implement Eq 5.3-3 first (Von Mises LRFD — closest to existing API 1111)
- Define `API_STD_2RD_CONDITIONS` with LRFD factors
- Wire into M-T report generation

### Phase 3 — Comparison
- Side-by-side report or comparison section
- Same pipe geometry, same loads → different utilisation under different codes
- Three-way comparison: API RP 1111 vs API RP 2RD vs API STD 2RD

### Phase 4 — Tests
- Unit tests for each equation for both codes
- Cross-code comparison tests (1111 vs RP 2RD vs STD 2RD for same inputs)
