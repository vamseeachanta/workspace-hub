# Add dynacard module README

## What
Create a README.md for the dynacard module documenting purpose, quickstart, API overview, calculator catalog, and solver comparison.

## Why
The module has 21 source files and 67 public API exports but no top-level documentation. A README makes it discoverable and usable by other developers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] README.md created in dynacard module directory
- [x] Covers: purpose, quickstart, calculator catalog, solver comparison
- [x] References API RP 11L and Gibbs 1963
