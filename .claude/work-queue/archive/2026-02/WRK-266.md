# Calibrate Decommissioning Cost Model — BSEE Platform Removal Data

## Why

`DecommissioningCostEstimator` (WRK-220) uses parametric formula constants. BSEE publishes
platform installation and removal records with actual cost proxies. Calibrating the model
against historical BSEE data replaces assumed constants with data-driven factors.

## What

- Load BSEE platform removal notices from existing BSEE module
- Extract: structure type, water depth, weight proxy, year, operator
- Fit cost factor constants to historical data
- Add `CostModelCalibration` class with `fit()` and `calibrated_estimator()` methods
- Expose calibration confidence intervals

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `CostModelCalibration.fit(bsee_removal_df)` updates cost constants
- [ ] Calibrated estimator available as `DecommissioningCostEstimator.from_calibration()`
- [ ] Calibration report: N records, fit quality, confidence intervals
- [ ] 20+ tests
