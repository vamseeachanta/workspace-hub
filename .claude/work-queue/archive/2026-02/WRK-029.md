# OrcaWave Diffraction Analysis Runner + File Preparation

## What
Add the ability to run OrcaWave diffraction analysis from digitalmodel. Includes file preparation with modular structure — decide between include-file approach (OrcaWave's native include mechanism) vs linear YAML-based combined file. Implement solver invocation and execution lifecycle.

## Why
OrcaWave is the Orcina diffraction solver and integrates tightly with OrcaFlex. Supporting OrcaWave alongside AQWA provides solver diversity and enables benchmarking. File preparation must be modular for the same reasons as AQWA — reuse, parametric studies, and error reduction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] OrcaWave solver invocation with configurable parameters
- [x] Modular file structure decision: include files vs YAML combined (document rationale)
- [x] Template system for common input patterns
- [x] Mesh/geometry input handling
- [x] Wave environment specification
- [x] Run status tracking and log capture
- [x] Integration with batch pipeline (WRK-030)
