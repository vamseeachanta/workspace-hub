# worldenergydata Test Coverage Improvement

## What
Increase worldenergydata test coverage from ~22.6% to 50%+. WRK-054 was planned but never executed. Recent modules (HSE risk index, decline curves, rig fleet, drilling riser) have good test coverage — the gap is in older/legacy modules.

## Why
- Active data pipeline development needs regression protection
- Recent WRK items (077, 024, 105, 014) added well-tested code — overall % dragged down by legacy
- Source path misconfiguration may be inflating the gap

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Coverage configuration fixed (source path, conftest issues)
- [ ] Accurate baseline measured after fix
- [ ] Legacy modules with 0% coverage identified
- [ ] Tests written for top 5 uncovered modules
- [ ] Overall coverage reaches 50%+

## Notes
- Original WRK-054 plan available in archive
- Use --noconftest flag due to py.path.local deprecation
- Test cmd: PYTHONPATH="src:../assetutilities/src" python3 -m pytest path -v --tb=short --noconftest
