# WRK-328 â€” Create ORCAFLEX_MODELS.md â€” per-example engineering model cards

**Status:** complete | **Priority:** high | **Percent complete:** 100

## Goal

Read the `includes/*.yml` files for representative OrcaFlex modular examples (one per
letter group) and produce `docs/domains/orcaflex/examples/ORCAFLEX_MODELS.md` â€” a
structured per-model engineering description that explains what each example actually
contains, not just its parameters.

## Scope

~12 representative examples, one per letter group:
A01 (catenary + lazy wave), B01 (drilling), C06 (CALM buoy), D02 (installation),
E01 (S-lay), F01 (subsea install), K01 (FOWT), L01 (vessel), L03 (semi-sub),
M01 (pipeline), Z02 (edge case)

## Output file

`digitalmodel/docs/domains/orcaflex/examples/ORCAFLEX_MODELS.md`

## Acceptance criteria

- Per-example model card: structure type, key object properties, analysis intent,
  environment summary, notable features, expected results
- Cross-reference to PARAMETER_REFERENCE.md and run_orcaflex.py scripts
- Covers all letter groups (Aâ€“M, Z) at least at summary level

## Route C Plan

- **Spec:** `specs/wrk/WRK-328/plan.md`
- **Plan reviewed:** yes
- **Plan approved:** yes (user-approved on 2026-02-26)

## Cross-Review Summary

| Iter | Date | Reviewer | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | 2026-02-24 | Claude | MINOR | Initial implementation review; gaps captured in plan log. |
| P2 | 2026-02-26 | Codex | APPROVE | Triage + redo pass validated deliverables against acceptance criteria. |
| P3 | 2026-02-26 | Gemini | MINOR | Independent CLI review deferred due local command timeout; no conflicting evidence from artifacts. |

## Agentic AI Horizon

This work item is suitable for LLM-led analysis and implementation because inputs are file-centric, acceptance criteria are machine-checkable, and outputs are deterministic artifacts (docs/scripts/tests). Remaining human role is adjudicating deferred external-review risks.
