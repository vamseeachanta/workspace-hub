# Clarify Family Dollar 1099-MISC Rent Amount Discrepancy ($50,085.60)

## What
Draft a clarification inquiry to Family Dollar regarding the 1099-MISC Rent amount of $50,085.60. Verify whether this amount is correct by cross-referencing against lease agreements, rent payment records, and bank deposits in the sabithaandkrishnaestates repo.

## Why
The 1099-MISC Rent amount of $50,085.60 needs to be verified for tax filing accuracy. If the amount is incorrect, a corrected 1099-MISC must be requested before filing deadlines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cross-reference $50,085.60 against lease terms and actual rent received
- [ ] Identify any discrepancy (overstated, understated, or includes non-rent items)
- [ ] Draft clarification letter/email to Family Dollar accounting
- [ ] Document findings in sabithaandkrishnaestates repo

## Plan
- **Files**: `sabithaandkrishnaestates/` — lease agreements, rent schedules, bank deposit records, 1099 documentation
- **Step 1**: Identify the tax year for the 1099-MISC in question (likely 2025). Extract monthly rent from lease agreement and compute expected annual total
- **Step 2**: Cross-reference against bank deposit records to confirm actual amounts received
- **Step 3**: Compare expected vs. reported ($50,085.60) — identify if discrepancy is from prorated months, CAM charges, late fees, or reporting error
- **Step 4**: Draft clarification email/letter to Family Dollar accounting citing lease terms and actual received amounts
- **Step 5**: Document findings in `sabithaandkrishnaestates/docs/`
- **Verify**: Review letter for accuracy before sending

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: APPROVE | Codex: APPROVE | Gemini: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - Added tax year identification to Step 1 (likely 2025)
  - Codex suggested reconciliation table format (CSV/Markdown) — implicit in Step 3 comparison
