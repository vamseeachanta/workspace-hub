# Enrich vessel fleet data with online research — current fleet status + newer surveys

## Context

WRK-357 extracted archival 2010/2011 Offshore Magazine survey data into:
- `frontierdeepwater/data/processed/vessel-fleet/pipelay-contractors-2011.csv` (116 vessels)
- `frontierdeepwater/data/processed/vessel-fleet/heavy-lift-vessels-2010.csv` (72 vessels)

Data is ~15 years old. Many vessels have been sold, renamed, scrapped, or upgraded.
Online research is needed to build current-status enrichment alongside the archival snapshots.

## What

### Part A — Online research: current vessel fleet status
For each vessel in the 2011 pipelay and 2010 heavy-lift CSVs:
1. Verify current status (active / stacked / scrapped / renamed)
2. Find IMO number (primary identifier; stable across ownership changes)
3. Find current owner/operator if vessel changed hands
4. Note major upgrades since 2010/2011 (e.g. S-lay → J-lay conversion, crane upgrades)

Sources to check (in priority order):
- VesselFinder / MarineTraffic (IMO, flag, current owner)
- Equasis (official EU ship registry — authoritative IMO lookup)
- Offshore Magazine online archives (2015–2024 newer surveys)
- Contractor websites (Allseas, Subsea 7, Saipem, Heerema, EMAS, etc.)
- Wikipedia (for notable vessels with public histories)

### Part B — Newer Offshore Magazine survey ingestion
Source and extract newer survey posters where available:
- Pipelay surveys: 2013, 2015, 2018, 2021, 2024
- Heavy-lift surveys: 2012, 2015, 2018, 2021, 2024

Use the same extractor (`scripts/python/extract_vessel_data.py`) for any PDFs found.
Archive new PDFs at `data/raw/offshore-magazine/` with naming convention:
  `pipelay-contractors-YYYY.csv` / `heavy-lift-vessels-YYYY.csv`

### Part C — Current fleet summary outputs
Produce enriched "current" views alongside archival snapshots:
- `data/processed/vessel-fleet/pipelay-contractors-current.csv`
  - Columns: all 2011 schema fields + `imo_number`, `current_owner`,
    `current_status` (active/stacked/scrapped/unknown), `status_year`,
    `source_url`, `archival_year`
- `data/processed/vessel-fleet/heavy-lift-vessels-current.csv`
  - Same enrichment fields

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 60% of 2011 pipelay vessels have IMO number resolved
- [ ] At least 60% of 2010 heavy-lift vessels have IMO number resolved
- [ ] Current status populated for all vessels where findable
- [ ] At least 1 newer survey (2015+) ingested and extracted if PDF is findable online
- [ ] `pipelay-contractors-current.csv` and `heavy-lift-vessels-current.csv` committed
- [ ] All online sources documented in `data/raw/offshore-magazine/README.md`

## Notes

- Use search agents (WebSearch + WebFetch tools) for batch vessel research
- VesselFinder URL pattern: `https://www.vesselFinder.com/vessels/detail/{IMO}`
- Do NOT scrape MarineTraffic at scale — use it for spot checks only
- If newer PDF surveys are found, download only with explicit approval
- Flag any vessels where online records conflict with poster data (renamed, etc.)
