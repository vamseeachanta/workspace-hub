# Saipem Repo Content Index — Searchable Catalog

## Problem

`saipem/README.md` has 6 lines of unfinished notes. The repo contains:
- Yellowtail project analysis (DBA, umbilical, rigging, flexible, ROV)
- Engineering discipline docs (CP, structural, mooring)
- Admin/onboarding PDFs
- General guidelines (analysis etiquette, modelling guidelines)

There is no index. Finding a specific calc or document requires knowing where to look.
This directly impacts the CP stream (WRK-269) — CP docs in `saipem/general/cp/` need to
be discoverable.

## What

Create `saipem/CONTENT_INDEX.md` — a structured, scannable catalog of repo contents.

### Structure

```markdown
# Saipem Repo Content Index

## Repo Purpose
[One paragraph: what this repo is, what project, what period]

## Quick Nav
| Area | Path | Content |
|------|------|---------|

## Engineering Disciplines
| Discipline | Path | Key Files |

## Yellowtail Project
| Deliverable | Path | Status/Rev |

## Admin & Onboarding
[Brief — not the focus]

## Search Tips
[How to find things — grep patterns, file naming conventions]
```

## Scope to Catalog

Scan and summarize:
- `general/` — discipline subdirs: cp, flexible, rov_access, slwr, spoolbase, engg, reports
- `yellowtail/` — project subdirs: dba, code, constellation, pro, rpt
- `admin/` — high-level only (admin docs don't need full index)
- Root-level markdown files

**Legal note**: This repo contains personal admin PDFs (W9, direct deposit). These should
not be referenced specifically in the index — list the `admin/quest/` folder as "personal
financial docs, not indexed" and move on.

## Why

- CP research (WRK-269) needs to reference `saipem/general/cp/` confidently
- Yellowtail DBA results and analysis patterns are reusable reference material
- The general engineering docs (analysis_etiquette.md, modelling_guidelines.md) are useful
  for any OrcaFlex work but currently undiscoverable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `saipem/CONTENT_INDEX.md` created
- [ ] All `general/` subdirs cataloged with discipline and key file count
- [ ] All `yellowtail/` subdirs cataloged with deliverable type
- [ ] Personal admin docs (W9, bank details) listed as "not indexed" — not skipped silently
- [ ] Quick Nav table works as a jump-to reference
- [ ] Index is readable in <2 minutes (doesn't need to be exhaustive)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Simple cataloging task — Gemini is well-suited (document summarization + structure)
- No code changes, no tests — pure documentation
- High value: every future session that touches saipem data benefits from this
- **Disposition: do now, Route A**
