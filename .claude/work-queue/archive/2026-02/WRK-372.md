# AI-Engineering Software Interface Skills

## What

Audit, map, and build the skill set AI agents need to effectively operate engineering software programs. Current skills contain domain knowledge (mooring analysis theory, fatigue methods) but lack the **software interface layer** — how an AI agent generates inputs, launches solvers, parses outputs, diagnoses failures, and chains programs together.

This item produces a **program-by-program AI interface skill** for each engineering program in the ecosystem, plus cross-program workflow skills for common analysis chains.

## Why

- 66 engineering skills exist but most teach "what" (domain knowledge), not "how" (drive the software)
- WRK-118 (AI strategy) defines provider allocation, not program-specific capabilities
- WRK-290 installs programs but doesn't teach AI how to operate them
- Without interface skills, AI agents can plan analyses but can't execute them autonomously
- Each program has its own input format, CLI flags, output structure, and failure modes
- The goal (WRK-235 roadmap) is agents operating autonomously by Aug 2026 — this is the missing link

## Scope

### Per-Program AI Interface Skills

For each program, create a skill covering:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Input generation** | File formats, required fields, templates, parametric generation |
| **Execution** | CLI commands, flags, Python API, batch modes, resource management |
| **Output parsing** | Result file formats, extraction patterns, structured data conversion |
| **Failure diagnosis** | Common errors, convergence issues, licensing problems, debugging steps |
| **Validation** | Sanity checks, known benchmarks, result range expectations |
| **Integration** | How this program connects to upstream/downstream tools |

### Programs to Cover (Priority Order)

| Priority | Program | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **P1** | OrcaFlex | 22 existing domain skills, 40+ WRK items, primary analysis tool |
| **P1** | OpenFOAM | Newly installed, zero skills, high autonomous potential (CLI-native) |
| **P1** | Gmsh | Mesh generation feeds multiple solvers, CLI + Python API |
| **P2** | AQWA | Licensed solver, complex input format, high client value |
| **P2** | Blender | 3D visualization, Python API, scripting-friendly |
| **P2** | ParaView | Post-processing for OpenFOAM/FEA, Python + CLI |
| **P3** | FreeCAD | Parametric CAD, Python API (skill exists, may need enhancement) |
| **P3** | OrcaWave | 7 existing skills, may just need interface layer additions |
| **P3** | QGIS | Pending installation and GIS skill (WRK-020) |
| **P3** | BEMRosetta | Niche converter, skill exists, low priority for enhancement |

### Cross-Program Workflow Skills

| Workflow | Chain | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Hydrodynamic analysis** | Gmsh -> OrcaWave/AQWA -> OrcaFlex | Full diffraction-to-dynamic pipeline |
| **CFD analysis** | FreeCAD/Gmsh -> OpenFOAM -> ParaView | Geometry to mesh to solve to visualize |
| **Visualization** | OrcaFlex results -> Blender/ParaView | Analysis results to 3D renders |
| **GIS-informed analysis** | QGIS -> digitalmodel -> OrcaFlex | Site data to analysis inputs |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Skill gap audit: matrix of existing 67 skills vs. interface capabilities (input gen, execution, output parse, failure diagnosis, validation) — completed 2026-02-23
- [x] P1-CREATE: OpenFOAM full interface skill created at `.claude/skills/engineering/cfd/openfoam/SKILL.md` — 2026-02-23
- [x] P1-ENHANCE: 7 OrcaFlex partial skills enhanced with failure diagnosis + validation — 2026-02-23
- [x] P1 remaining: Gmsh already full-interface (confirmed in audit) — 2026-02-23
- [x] P2 interface skills created: Blender (`cad/blender/SKILL.md`), ParaView (`cfd/paraview/SKILL.md`) — 2026-02-23
- [x] P2-ENHANCE: FreeCAD enhanced with output parsing, failure diagnosis, validation — 2026-02-23
- [x] P3 interface skills reviewed: OrcaWave (adequate, 7 full-interface), Gmsh (adequate), BEMRosetta (adequate) — 2026-02-23
- [x] At least 2 cross-program workflow skills documented: CFD pipeline + Hydrodynamic pipeline (`workflows/`) — 2026-02-23
- [x] Skills integrated into `.claude/skills/engineering/` directory structure — 2026-02-23
- [x] P2 remaining: AQWA — new `aqwa-batch-execution` skill created 2026-02-24 (CLI execution, DAT structure, failure diagnosis, SLURM integration, validation checklist)
- [ ] P3 remaining: QGIS — blocked by WRK-020 (GIS skill + installation)
- [ ] Each skill validated: AI agent can complete a basic end-to-end task using only the skill as reference

## Approach

### Phase 1 — Skill Gap Audit

Audit all 66 existing engineering skills against the interface capability matrix. For each skill, classify:
- **Domain-only**: teaches theory/methods, no software interface
- **Partial interface**: some input/output patterns but incomplete
- **Full interface**: covers input, execution, output, validation

Output: gap matrix showing which programs need new skills vs. skill enhancement.

### Phase 2 — P1 Interface Skills (OrcaFlex, OpenFOAM, Gmsh)

For each P1 program, research and document:
- Available CLI/API interface (man pages, --help, Python API docs)
- Input file format with annotated templates
- Common execution patterns with example commands
- Output file parsing with code snippets
- Top 10 failure modes with diagnostic steps
- Validation checklist

### Phase 3 — P2 Interface Skills (AQWA, Blender, ParaView)

Same structure as Phase 2 for P2 programs.

### Phase 4 — Cross-Program Workflows

Document 2-3 end-to-end workflows that chain programs, including:
- Data flow between programs (which output feeds which input)
- Format conversion requirements
- Error propagation and where to validate

### Phase 5 — Validation

Test each skill by having an AI agent complete a representative task:
- OrcaFlex: generate a simple mooring model, run, extract max tension
- OpenFOAM: set up cavity tutorial, run, extract residuals
- Gmsh: create a cylinder mesh, export for OpenFOAM

## Agentic AI Horizon

- This item IS the bridge between domain knowledge and autonomous engineering execution
- Without interface skills, agents remain advisors; with them, agents become operators
- Directly enables the WRK-235 roadmap goal of autonomous agent operation by Aug 2026
- **Disposition: invest now** — highest-leverage gap in the current skill library; every engineering WRK item benefits once interface skills exist

## Phase 1 Results — Skill Gap Audit (2026-02-23)

### Overall Totals (67 skills audited)

| Classification | Count | % |
|----------------|-------|---|
| **Full interface** (4-5 capabilities) | 34 | 50.7% |
| **Partial interface** (2-3 capabilities) | 16 | 23.9% |
| **Domain-only** (0-1 capabilities) | 17 | 25.4% |

### Capability Coverage Across All Skills

| Capability | YES | PARTIAL | NO | Weakest Area |
|-----------|-----|---------|-----|-------------|
| Input generation | 39 (58%) | 8 (12%) | 20 (30%) | — |
| Execution | 37 (55%) | 7 (10%) | 23 (34%) | — |
| Output parsing | 34 (51%) | 6 (9%) | 27 (40%) | — |
| **Failure diagnosis** | **18 (27%)** | **18 (27%)** | **31 (46%)** | **Weakest** |
| Validation | 34 (51%) | 13 (19%) | 20 (30%) | — |

**Key finding**: Failure diagnosis is the weakest capability ecosystem-wide — only 27% of skills have full coverage. This is the single highest-impact area to improve.

### Gap Matrix by Program

| Program | Skills | Full | Partial | Domain | Missing | Action |
|---------|--------|------|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| **OrcaFlex** | 26 | 20 | 5 | 1 | Failure diagnosis weakest (many PARTIAL) | Enhance: add failure diagnosis sections to partial skills |
| **OrcaWave** | 7 | 7 | 0 | 0 | Strong across all 5 | Adequate — no action needed |
| **AQWA** | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | Thin coverage (3 skills total) | Consider: 1-2 more skills for input format + batch |
| **BEMRosetta** | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | Adequate for converter role | Adequate — no action needed |
| **Gmsh** | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | Strong (gmsh-meshing is gold standard) | Adequate — no action needed |
| **FreeCAD** | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Output parsing, failure diag, validation all missing | **Enhance**: add 3 missing capability sections |
| **OpenFOAM** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **No skill at all** | **CREATE**: full interface skill (P1) |
| **Blender** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **No skill at all** (code exists, no skill) | **CREATE**: interface skill (P2) |
| **ParaView** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **No skill at all** | **CREATE**: interface skill (P2) |
| **QGIS** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **No skill at all** | **CREATE**: interface skill (P3, after WRK-020) |
| *General/none* | 17 | 0 | 4 | 13 | Domain knowledge only | Keep as reference; no interface action needed |

### Domain-Only Skills (17 — no software interface)

These are pure engineering knowledge references. They serve as domain context for AI agents but don't enable software operation:

**Marine-offshore (9)**: fatigue-analysis, hydrodynamic-analysis, marine-offshore-engineering, marine-safety, mooring-analysis, naval-architecture, production-engineering, ship-dynamics-6dof, structural-analysis, wave-theory

**Standards (5)**: api, astm, dnv, iso, norsok

**Other (3)**: oil-and-gas, drilling, financial-analysis

### Partial-Interface Skills Needing Enhancement (16)

These are the highest-ROI improvement targets — close to full-interface, need 1-2 capabilities added:

**OrcaFlex (7)**: orcaflex-environment-config, orcaflex-installation-analysis, orcaflex-line-wizard, orcaflex-modal-analysis, orcaflex-static-debug, orcaflex-yaml-gotchas, mooring-design

**General marine (3)**: fe-analyst, hydrodynamic-analysis, risk-assessment, signal-analysis

**CAD (2)**: cad-engineering, freecad-automation

**Other (2)**: fitness-for-service, units

### Priority Action Plan (derived from audit)

| Priority | Action | Programs | Effort |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **P1-CREATE** | Build new full interface skill | OpenFOAM | High — zero base |
| **P1-ENHANCE** | Add failure diagnosis to 5 OrcaFlex partial skills | OrcaFlex | Medium — content exists |
| **P2-CREATE** | Build new interface skills | Blender, ParaView | Medium each |
| **P2-ENHANCE** | Complete freecad-automation (output, failure, validation) | FreeCAD | Low — partial exists |
| **P3-CREATE** | Build after dependencies resolve | QGIS (after WRK-020) | Medium |
| **P3-CONFIRM** | Already adequate | OrcaWave, Gmsh, BEMRosetta | None |
