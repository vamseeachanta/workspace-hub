# WRK-110: Expand hull size library with FST, LNGC, and benchmark shapes

## Description

Build out the hull geometry library with standard shapes from three sources:
a) FST (Floating Storage Terminal) hull forms — barge-type and ship-type variants
b) LNGC (LNG Carrier) hull forms — conventional, Q-Flex, Q-Max size classes
c) OrcaFlex benchmark shapes — adopt existing benchmark geometries (barge, ship, spar, semi) as standard library entries

## Context

- Current hull shapes are ad-hoc per benchmark (L02 barge, L03 ship, L04 spar)
- No centralized hull library with standard dimensions and mesh files
- FSTs and LNGCs are critical for offshore LNG mooring and motion analysis
- OrcaFlex examples provide well-validated simple shapes that serve as good baselines

## Scope

### a) FST Hull Forms
1. Research standard FST dimensions (length, beam, depth, draft) for typical storage capacities
2. Create parametric hull definitions (box barge, ship-shaped FSO/FST)
3. Generate panel meshes suitable for OrcaWave (target 2000-5000 panels)

### b) LNGC Hull Forms
1. Catalogue standard LNGC size classes with principal dimensions:
   - Conventional: ~138k m3, ~270m LOA
   - Q-Flex: ~210k m3, ~315m LOA
   - Q-Max: ~266k m3, ~345m LOA
2. Create hull definitions with standard block coefficients
3. Generate panel meshes for diffraction analysis

### c) OrcaFlex Benchmark Shapes as Standard Library
1. Formalize existing benchmark meshes (barge, ship, spar) as library entries
2. Add principal dimensions, displacement, and hydrostatic metadata
3. Ensure consistent naming and directory structure

## Key Files

- Existing meshes: `data/hull_library/panels/` (canonical location)
- Catalog: `data/hull_library/catalog/hull_panel_catalog.yaml`
- Mesh generation: `src/digitalmodel/hydrodynamics/hull_library/mesh_generator.py`
- Catalog schema: `src/digitalmodel/hydrodynamics/hull_library/panel_catalog.py`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Hull library directory structure established with consistent naming
- [x] At least 2 FST hull forms catalogued with dimensions and meshes
- [x] At least 3 LNGC hull forms catalogued (conventional, Q-Flex, Q-Max)
- [x] OrcaFlex benchmark shapes (barge, ship, spar) already present as standard library entries
- [x] Each hull entry includes: principal dimensions, displacement, mesh file, metadata
- [x] Meshes validated for OrcaWave compatibility (panel count, normals, watertightness)
- [x] Index file or manifest listing all available hulls

## Results

- **Commit**: `11d3e2db2` (digitalmodel)
- **New profiles**: 4 YAML hull profiles (fst_barge_250m, fst_ship_330m, lngc_qflex_315m, lngc_qmax_345m)
- **New meshes**: 4 GDF panel meshes (2000-2415 panels each, Y-symmetric)
- **Catalog**: 27 total entries (23 existing + 4 new)
- **Tests**: 26 new tests, all passing (196 total hull_library tests pass)
- **Script**: `scripts/generate_hull_library_meshes.py` for mesh regeneration
- **Deferred**: OrcaFlex benchmark shapes already in catalog from WRK-114; no additional formalization needed

## Plan

**Target**: `data/hull_library/panels/` (extend existing library) + `data/hull_library/catalog/hull_panel_catalog.yaml`

### Existing Assets (reuse)
- `data/hull_library/panels/` — 14 GDF meshes across 7 categories (barges, FPSO, LNGC, primitives, semi_subs, ships, spars)
- `data/hull_library/catalog/hull_panel_catalog.yaml` — 23 entries with dimensions, panel counts, symmetry
- Benchmark meshes: barge (WRK-100 r4), ship (r1), spar (r1) — validated against AQWA + OrcaWave
- `src/digitalmodel/hydrodynamics/hull_library/mesh_generator.py` — GDF mesh generation
- `src/digitalmodel/hydrodynamics/hull_library/panel_catalog.py` — PanelCatalogEntry schema
- Hull panel generator (WRK-106) — parametric mesh creation from line definitions (Phase 2 depends on this)

### Phase 1 — Research Hull Dimensions
**FST forms**:
- Barge-type FST: 250m × 46m × 14m draft (typical 300k bbl storage)
- Ship-type FSO: 330m × 60m × 22m draft (typical converted VLCC)
- Sources: DNV class records, operator fleet pages, public project EIAs

**LNGC forms**:
- Conventional (138k m3): 270m × 43m × 11.5m draft, Cb=0.76
- Q-Flex (210k m3): 315m × 50m × 12.0m draft, Cb=0.78
- Q-Max (266k m3): 345m × 55m × 12.0m draft, Cb=0.80
- Sources: Samsung/DSME public specs, IGC Code dimensions, ABS/LR class guidance

### Phase 2 — Generate Panel Meshes
- Use hull panel generator (WRK-106) or gmsh with parametric scripts
- Target panel density: 2000-5000 panels per hull (convergence-suitable)
- FST barge: box barge geometry with rounded bilge
- FST ship-type: ship-form with fine bow, parallel midbody, cruiser stern
- LNGC: prismatic hull with Cb-consistent sections
- Output format: GDF (OrcaWave/Wamit compatible)

### Phase 3 — Formalize Benchmark Shapes
- Copy existing benchmark meshes to canonical library locations:
  - `data/hull_library/panels/barges/benchmark_barge.gdf`
  - `data/hull_library/panels/ships/benchmark_ship.gdf`
  - `data/hull_library/panels/spars/benchmark_spar.gdf`
- Add metadata: principal dimensions, displacement, draft, hydrostatic coefficients
- Cross-reference to benchmark reports (r4 barge, r1 ship, r1 spar)

### Phase 4 — Catalog Integration
- Add all new entries to `hull_panel_catalog.yaml`
- Fields per entry: name, category, LOA, beam, draft, displacement, panel_count, symmetry, mesh_file, source
- Update catalog report (HTML) with new entries
- Validate: each mesh loads in OrcaWave/AQWA without errors
