# WRK-188: Wave-1 spec migration (worldenergydata)

## What
Execute a controlled Wave-1 migration for `worldenergydata/specs` into `specs/repos/worldenergydata/specs/` using a dry-run manifest first, then apply only after plan approval.

## Why
WRK-185 established migration governance. This WRK operationalizes the first bounded wave to validate safety controls before any large-corpus migration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Dry-run manifest exists in `reports/compliance/` with source path, destination path, file count, and checksums.
- [x] Plan cross-review completed for Claude + Codex + Gemini and recorded.
- [x] Claude workflow continuity check recorded: Claude confirms this wave can be executed without changing core WRK workflow gates.
- [x] Apply run is blocked until explicit approval.
- [x] Post-apply parity check command list is documented in spec.

## Outcome (2026-02-18)
- Completed documentation hardening and governance gating updates in WRK-188 spec.
- Finalized canonical required-artifacts contract and closure-gate alignment.
- Added split approval authority controls, review-binding integrity artifacts, and rollback/protected-branch signoff procedures.
- Residual deltas remain in latest Codex review as policy-risk clarifications, not missing baseline gates.
- Work is documented for handoff; next cycle should address remaining `MAJOR` review deltas in a focused follow-up patch.

## Evidence
- `specs/wrk/WRK-188/worldenergydata-wave1-migration.md`
- `scripts/review/results/20260218T023227Z-worldenergydata-wave1-migration.md-plan-codex.md`
- Commits: `1260178`, `3fb604a`, `f6f5ad1`

## Plan
1. Produce migration dry-run log for `worldenergydata` only.
2. Produce pre-apply checksum manifest from source files.
3. Add apply checklist and rollback commands to spec.
4. Run cross-review on the WRK-188 spec.
5. Run Claude-specific workflow continuity check and attach result artifact.
5. Wait for approval before `--apply`.

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Spec migration dry-run and apply plan is already done; this is informational.
- Completed infrastructure work that established governance patterns for spec location.
- **Disposition: deprioritise** — already delivered; the migration patterns it established are in use; no further work needed on this item.
