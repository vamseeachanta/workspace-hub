# CP Standards Research — Inventory Codes, Map Version Gaps, Define Implementation Scope

## What

Read and inventory all cathodic protection codes available in the workspace, document
technical differences between versions, and produce a clear matrix of what the code
currently implements vs. what standards exist vs. what needs sourcing or updating.

This is the prerequisite for WRK-271 (worked examples) and WRK-272 (capability extension).

## Full Standards Inventory (Pre-Research — Confirmed Available)

### DNV-RP-B401 (Offshore CP Design)

| Edition | File | Location |
|---------|------|----------|
| 1993 | `DNV_RP_B401_(1993)_Cathodic_Protection_Design.pdf` | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/DNV/` |
| 2005 (+ 2008 amend) | `DNV_RP_B401_with_2008_amendments_(2005)_Cathodic_Protection_Design.pdf` | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/DNV/` |
| 2011 | `DNV_RP_B401_(2011)_Cathodic_Protection_Design.pdf` | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/DNV/` AND `digitalmodel/docs/domains/cathodic_protection/codes/` |
| **2021** | `DNV-RP-B401-2021.pdf` | `acma-projects/B1522/ctr-2/cal/` ← **NEWEST** |

Code implements: **2011 methodology** (unverified — confirm during research)

### DNV-RP-F103 (Submarine Pipeline CP)

| Edition | File | Location |
|---------|------|----------|
| 2003 | `DNV_RP_F103_(2003)_Cathodic_protection_of_submarine_pipelines_by_galvanic_anodes.pdf` | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/DNV/` |
| 2010 | `DNV_RP_F103_(2010)_Cathodic_Protection_of_Submarine_Pipelines_by_Galvanic_Anodes.pdf` | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/DNV/` |
| **2016** | Not as standalone PDF — **available via GP 56-01-04U_4.pdf** (ExxonMobil impl.) | `saipem/general/cp/` AND `acma-projects/B1522/ctr-2/ref/proj/exxon/` |

Code implements: **DNV_RP_F103_2010**

### ABS GN Ships (Ship Hull CP)

| Edition | File | Location |
|---------|------|----------|
| Dec 2017 (2018) | `ABS cathodic-protection-of-ships-gn-dec17.pdf` | `acma-projects/B1522/ctr-2/ref/` AND `digitalmodel/docs/domains/cathodic_protection/codes/` |

Code implements: **ABS_gn_ships_2018** (= Dec 2017 edition)

### ABS GN Offshore Structures (Offshore Platform CP)

| Edition | File | Location |
|---------|------|----------|
| Dec 2018 | `ABS cathodic-protection-offshore-gn-dec18.pdf` | `digitalmodel/docs/domains/cathodic_protection/codes/` (verify) |

Code implements: **NOT IMPLEMENTED** — gap for WRK-272

### ISO 15589-2 (Offshore Pipeline CP)

| Edition | File | Location |
|---------|------|----------|
| 2004 | `ISO15589-2-2004forOR_Cathodic_Protection.pdf` | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/ISO/` |

Code implements: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

### Other Standards Available

| Standard | File | Location |
|----------|------|----------|
| SNAME T&R R-21 | `SNAME T&R R-21 Cathodic Protection Marine Service.pdf` | `acma-projects/B1522/ctr-2/ref/` |
| DNV-RP-F112 2008 | Stainless steel exposed to CP | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/DNV/` |
| API RP 1632 1996 | Underground tank CP | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/API/` |
| NACE MR0175 Pt3 2009 | CRA / corrosion-resistant alloys | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/` |
| ASTM G42/G80/G95/G8 | Cathodic disbonding test methods | `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/ASTM/` |

### Still Missing (Needs Sourcing)

| Standard | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| DNVGL-RP-F103 2016 standalone | Use GP 56-01-04U as methodology reference until sourced |
| ABS GN Offshore 2018 | Online at eagle.org — download if not in digitalmodel/docs |
| NACE SP0169 | External pipeline corrosion — not in library |
| NACE SP0176/RP0176 | Fixed offshore platforms — not in library |
| ISO 15589-1 | Onshore pipeline CP — not in library |

## ExxonMobil Global Practice Standards (Methodology Reference)

These implement the DNVGL editions and provide calculation methodology detail:

| File | Implements | Location |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `GP 56-01-04U_4.pdf` | DNVGL-RP-F103 **2016** | `saipem/general/cp/` + `acma-projects/B1522/ctr-2/ref/proj/exxon/` |
| `GP 56-01-08U_Rev1.0_external.pdf` | DNVGL-RP-B401 **2017** | Same |
| `GYFI-GP-USPDS-11-0012...pdf` | Saipem CP requirements spec | Same |

These are the best available proxy for DNVGL 2016/2017 methodology — use for WRK-272.

## What to Produce

### 1. Standards version comparison matrix

For DNV-RP-B401 (1993 → 2005 → 2011 → 2021) and DNV-RP-F103 (2003 → 2010 → 2016):
- Key technical differences between editions (current density tables, anode utilisation, formula changes)
- Which edition our code currently implements
- Recommended target edition for WRK-272

### 2. Code coverage audit

For `cathodic_protection.py` (1,531 lines):
- Map each calculation method to its standard+edition reference
- Flag any method that may diverge between 2010 and 2016 editions of DNV-RP-F103
- Identify discrepancies vs. 2021 edition of DNV-RP-B401

### 3. Gap priority matrix

- **P1**: Standards where our code may diverge from the referenced edition
- **P2**: High-value unimplemented standards (ABS GN Offshore, ISO 15589-2)
- **P3**: Standards covered by code but not yet tested against PDF
- **P4**: Nice-to-have future expansion (NACE, ISO 15589-1)

### 4. Go/no-go recommendation

Produce a clear go/no-go for WRK-271 (worked examples) against each structure type:
- Pipeline (DNV F103 2010): can proceed against available PDF?
- Ship hull (ABS GN Ships 2017): can proceed?
- Offshore platform (DNV B401 2021): can proceed now that 2021 PDF is available?

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All in-repo / accessible PDFs read and summarised (title, edition, scope, key formula sets)
- [ ] DNV-RP-B401 2011 vs 2021 differences documented (B401 2021 is at `acma-projects/B1522/ctr-2/cal/`)
- [ ] DNV-RP-F103 2010 vs 2016 differences documented (use GP 56-01-04U for 2016 methodology)
- [ ] Standards version matrix written to `digitalmodel/docs/domains/cathodic_protection/standards-inventory.md`
- [ ] Code coverage audit in same document
- [ ] Go/no-go recommendation for WRK-271 per structure type
- [ ] Sourcing list: which standards still needed and where to obtain

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Research task — well-suited to Gemini (large context, document summarization)
- All key PDFs are now locally available — no blocking sourcing dependencies
- **Disposition: do now** — gates WRK-271/272; all standards now available to proceed
