# Run 3-Way Benchmark on Barge Hull

## What
Execute the 3-way benchmark comparison using the Barge hull (100m × 30m × 6m) as a practical offshore case.

## Why
The Barge is a common offshore structure with simple geometry but realistic dimensions. Tests solver behavior at practical scales and frequencies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create unified DiffractionSpec for Barge
- [x] Mesh: ~500-1000 panels (coarsen if needed using mesh-utilities skill)
- [x] All 3 solvers complete successfully
- [x] Benchmark comparison produces MAJORITY or better consensus
- [x] Output: JSON report, HTML report, overlay plots
- [x] Compare with Unit Box results to identify scale-dependent differences

## Plan

- **Step 1**: Reuse solver input generation workflow established in WRK-099. Generate barge mesh (~500-1000 panels for 100m x 30m x 6m hull; use gmsh or manual GDF). Verify mesh quality metrics (max aspect ratio, panel count target). Confirm gmsh availability on target machine.
- **Step 2**: Create unified `DiffractionSpec` for barge (18,000 Te, draft 4m, water depth 100m)
- **Step 3**: Run all 3 solvers using `BenchmarkRunner`
- **Step 4**: Compare results; expect MAJORITY consensus
- **Step 5**: Compare with Unit Box (WRK-099) results to identify scale-dependent differences. Add numeric tolerance for comparisons vs Unit Box. Define how hydrostatics are matched across solvers.
- **Step 6**: Generate reports and document findings
- **Blocked by**: WRK-099 (Unit Box benchmark must complete first)

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: APPROVE | Codex: MINOR | Gemini: MINOR
- **Actions taken**:
  - Added reuse of WRK-099 solver input generation workflow
  - Added mesh quality metrics and gmsh availability verification per Gemini feedback
  - Added numeric tolerance for cross-benchmark comparisons per Codex feedback
  - Added hydrostatic matching requirement across solvers

## Notes
- Barge benchmark r4 complete. All 6 DOFs positive phase, heave ~1.000. Report at benchmark_output/barge_benchmark/r4/
