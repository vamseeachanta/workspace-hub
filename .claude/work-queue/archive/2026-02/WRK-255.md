# Hull library lookup skill — closest-match hull form by target dimensions

## What
Build a hull library lookup skill: given target vessel dimensions (LOA, beam, draft, displacement), returns the closest matching hull form from the library with similarity score and scaling factors needed to match target.

## Why
The hull size library was expanded (WRK-110) but has no agent-callable lookup. Agents setting up hydrodynamic analyses select hull forms manually. This is the first step in WRK-243 (hull analysis setup skill).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `get_hull_form(target_dimensions)` returns best match with similarity score and scaling factors
- [ ] Covers FST, LNGC, and OrcaFlex benchmark shapes
- [ ] Integrated as the first step in WRK-243 (hull analysis setup skill)
- [ ] Tested against 3 target dimension sets

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Prerequisite for WRK-243 hull analysis setup skill — without this lookup, agents cannot autonomously select hull forms
- Library exists (WRK-110); lookup logic is minimal; similarity scoring is a straightforward nearest-neighbour calculation
- **Disposition: invest now** — library exists, lookup is minimal effort, prerequisite for WRK-243
