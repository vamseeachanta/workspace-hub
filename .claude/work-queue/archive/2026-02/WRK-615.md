# Organize files and establish directory structure in CAD-DEVELOPMENTS

## What

Move the 13 flat files in CAD-DEVELOPMENTS/ into a proper directory hierarchy and add essential repo hygiene files (.gitignore, updated README.md). This is Phase 1 of WRK-610 executed as a standalone deliverable.

## Why

All 13 files currently sit at the repo root with no organisation. Before registering as a workspace-hub submodule or building AI-agent scaffolding (WRK-611-614), the repo needs a clean, navigable layout that reflects the AI-agent FEA pipeline mission.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Directory structure created: geometry/hull/ geometry/instruments/ mesh/ analysis/ results/ agents/ docs/ specs/
- [ ] All 12 FreeCAD .FCStd files moved to geometry/hull/
- [ ] CTD.blend moved to geometry/instruments/
- [ ] .gitignore added: *.FCStd1, *.FCBak, *.blend1, results/, *.vtk, *.vtu, mesh/*.msh, __pycache__/, *.py[cod]
- [ ] README.md updated: mission, pipeline diagram, directory guide, tools, collaborator credit
- [ ] geometry/hull/README.md with file inventory table
- [ ] All changes committed and pushed to bakkiprasad5669/CAD-DEVELOPMENTS

## Plan

Route A - Simple. Direct implementation.

- Files: geometry/hull/ (new), geometry/instruments/ (new), mesh/, analysis/, results/, agents/, docs/, specs/, .gitignore, README.md, geometry/hull/README.md
- Change: git mv all .FCStd files into geometry/hull/; git mv CTD.blend geometry/instruments/; create placeholder dirs with .gitkeep; write .gitignore; rewrite README.md
- Test: git status shows all moves tracked; git ls-files geometry/ shows all 13 files under new paths
- Verify: Push to bakkiprasad5669/CAD-DEVELOPMENTS; confirm GitHub shows new structure

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Clean directory layout makes the repo immediately navigable by AI agents discovering it cold
- geometry/hull/ as a stable path means WRK-611 (fcstd_parser) and WRK-612 (mesh_agent) can hardcode relative paths
- Placeholder dirs signal the intended pipeline stages to future contributors and agents
