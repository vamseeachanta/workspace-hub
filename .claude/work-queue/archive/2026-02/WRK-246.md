# LNG terminal dataset — queryable module and aceengineer website data card

## What
(a) Expose the global LNG terminal dataset as a queryable module in worldenergydata with a standardised API. (b) Add a data card or interactive table to the aceengineer website using the dataset. (c) Add to WRK-076 data refresh scheduler.

## Why
The LNG dataset is a high-value differentiating asset (rare, curated) that is neither queryable by agents nor visible to clients. Both gaps are straightforward to close.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `worldenergydata.lng.terminals` queryable by region, capacity, and status
- [ ] Website data card or interactive table published on aceengineer-website
- [ ] Refresh schedule configured in WRK-076 data refresh scheduler
- [ ] Agents can call the module without knowing the underlying file structure

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Dual value: client-facing marketing asset and agent-queryable data source
- Data exists; exposure is the only gap — agents cannot access unregistered datasets
- **Disposition: invest now** — data exists, both the API and website card are well-scoped work
