# Cross-database marine safety case study — MAIB, IMO, EMSA, TSB correlation analysis

## What
Create a cross-database marine safety case study combining MAIB, IMO, EMSA, and TSB data. Identify cross-database incident correlations. Publish on the aceengineer website as a client-facing asset.

## Why
All four international marine safety importers are operational (WRK-074) but there is no cross-database analysis. A multi-source marine safety analysis is a compelling demonstration of worldenergydata's breadth.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cross-database query combining at least 3 of the 4 sources (MAIB, IMO, EMSA, TSB)
- [ ] At least one cross-database correlation finding documented
- [ ] Published on aceengineer website
- [ ] Agents can regenerate the analysis from the importers

## Agentic AI Horizon
- High-value marketing asset demonstrating worldenergydata breadth; also validates multi-source agent query capability
- All importers are ready; cross-database analysis and content generation are the remaining work
- **Disposition: do now** — data and importers ready, analysis and publication is the gap
