# Add Drilling Riser Component Data

## What
Create a drilling riser data module in worldenergydata covering the full riser system component inventory: regular riser joints (dimensions, weight, buoyancy), pup joints, flex/ball joints, telescopic joints, kill/choke lines, BOPs (dimensions, weight, pressure ratings), LMRPs, riser tensioner specs, and associated auxiliary equipment data.

## Why
Drilling riser engineering requires readily accessible component data for system design, analysis input (e.g. OrcaFlex models per WRK-046), weight calculations, and procurement. A structured dataset of standard riser components from major manufacturers enables rapid model setup and parametric studies without manual data entry each time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Data schema for riser joints (OD, ID, wall thickness, weight in air/water, buoyancy modules, length, grade)
- [x] Data schema for BOPs (type, dimensions, weight, pressure rating, bore size)
- [x] Data schema for LMRPs, flex joints, telescopic joints
- [x] Data for standard riser sizes (21", 18-3/4", etc.) from public specs
- [x] BOP stack configurations (surface, subsea) with component breakdown
- [x] Data loader with query by component type, size, pressure rating
- [x] Storage format consistent with existing worldenergydata patterns
- [x] Unit tests for data loading and schema validation

## Plan

**Target**: `src/worldenergydata/vessel_fleet/drilling_riser/` (integrate with existing `vessel_fleet/` module — no `vessels/` directory exists)

### Phase 1 — Data Schemas
- `riser_joint_schema.py` — OD, ID, WT, weight_air, weight_water, buoyancy_coverage, length, grade, connection_type
- `bop_schema.py` — type (surface/subsea), dimensions, weight, pressure_rating, bore_size, ram_types
- `auxiliary_schema.py` — LMRP, flex_joint (stiffness, max_angle), telescopic_joint (stroke), kill_choke_lines

### Phase 2 — Data Collection
- Primary public sources: API specifications (16A for BOP, 16R for marine riser, 17D for subsea wellheads) for standard sizes and ratings
- OEM-specific data (Cameron, NOV, Dril-Quip) available from public product brochures and conference papers, not proprietary APIs. Define a minimal public data subset if OEM specs are gated.
- Standard riser sizes: 21", 18-3/4" with typical buoyancy modules
- BOP stack configurations: surface, subsea with component breakdown
- Add units and standard normalization rules in schema (SI units throughout)
- Include sample records with expected value ranges in tests
- Store as CSV in `data/modules/vessel_fleet/csv/drilling_riser/` (aligned with `data/catalog/data-catalog.yml` patterns)

### Phase 3 — Data Loader
- `riser_loader.py` — Query by component type, size, pressure rating
- Integration with WRK-046 OrcaFlex drilling riser models

### Phase 4 — Tests
- Schema validation, loader tests, known component spot-checks

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MINOR | Gemini: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - Fixed target path from `vessels/drilling_riser/` to `vessel_fleet/drilling_riser/` (no `vessels/` module exists)
  - Replaced OEM API assumption with public sources: API specifications (16A, 16R, 17D) and public product brochures
  - Added minimal public data subset fallback if OEM specs are gated
  - Added units/normalization rules and sample records with expected ranges per Codex feedback
  - Aligned data storage path with existing data catalog patterns
