# digitalmodel capability manifest — machine-readable module index for agent discovery

## What
Generate a machine-readable capability manifest for digitalmodel modules (analogous to what WRK-205 did for skills). Wire into the skills knowledge graph so agents can discover engineering capabilities by type (e.g. "what modules handle fatigue?").

## Why
Module discoverability was improved manually (WRK-066) but the standard has risen — agents need a queryable index, not human-readable docs. Significant new modules have been added since WRK-066.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `digitalmodel/capability-manifest.yaml` generated and maintained
- [ ] Schema covers: module name, domain, inputs, outputs, test count, status
- [ ] Wired into skills knowledge graph (WRK-205)
- [ ] Agents can query "modules by domain" (e.g. fatigue, wall thickness, hydrodynamics)

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Foundation for autonomous engineering task routing — agents need a machine-readable index to select the right module for a given task
- Generates from existing code; manifest schema is well-understood from WRK-205 precedent
- **Disposition: invest now** — generates from existing code, low effort, prerequisite for smart agent routing
