# Incorporate SPE Drillbotics Mission into ACE Engineering Vision and Strategy

## What

SPE Drillbotics is an annual applied R&D competition run by the SPE Drilling Systems
Advancement Technical Section. Teams build and operate miniature drilling rigs (physical
track) or develop virtual drilling automation systems (virtual track), working through the
full engineering lifecycle: problem definition → design → prototyping → testing → deployment.

The competition's core mission is to bridge academic learning and industry practice through
real-world drilling automation challenges, developing: automation engineering, multidisciplinary
collaboration, leadership under pressure, and systems thinking.

This work item incorporates that mission into the ACE Engineering strategy — identifying
where Drillbotics aligns with existing capabilities, where it reveals gaps, and how ACE
Engineering can engage (participant support, tooling, research output, or direct
involvement).

## Why

Drillbotics sits at the intersection of three ACE Engineering strengths:
- **Drilling engineering domain** (digitalmodel production-engineering module, worldenergydata
  drilling-expert agent, acma-projects O&G client work)
- **Automation and AI orchestration** (the autonomous-production vision in WRK-373)
- **Leadership and early-career development** (the competition explicitly develops the
  engineer-as-orchestrator profile that the AAAP future demands)

Engaging with Drillbotics — whether by developing tooling for virtual-track teams, writing
up domain skills, or contributing to the competition community — positions ACE Engineering
at the leading edge of drilling automation while building brand recognition in the SPE
community.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Drillbotics virtual-track requirements understood: what software, simulation, and
  automation skills are expected from competing teams
- [ ] Gap analysis complete: which Drillbotics technical areas are already covered by
  ACE Engineering capabilities (digitalmodel, assetutilities, worldenergydata) and which
  are missing
- [ ] Engagement mode decided: one of (a) develop open tooling for Drillbotics virtual
  teams, (b) write up a Drillbotics-specific skill/guide, (c) document ACE Engineering's
  relevant capabilities as a potential industry sponsor/partner, (d) direct team
  participation
- [ ] Chosen engagement mode produces at least one concrete output (doc, skill, capability,
  or contact made)
- [ ] VISION.md updated with Drillbotics as a named strategic touchpoint if engagement
  mode (a), (b), or (c) is selected

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Drillbotics virtual track is explicitly about drilling automation programming — precisely
  the engineering-software-AI-interface domain of WRK-372
- A virtual-track Drillbotics agent (receives drill parameters → plans trajectory →
  executes virtual rig → reports results) is a clean proof-of-concept for Level 4
  autonomous engineering workflow
- Supporting or building this is a way to validate the autonomous-production vision
  (WRK-373) against a concrete, externally-defined engineering problem with published
  scoring criteria
- Disposition: **invest** — low cost to engage, high signal value as an external benchmark
