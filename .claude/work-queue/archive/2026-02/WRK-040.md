# Mooring benchmarking - AQWA vs OrcaFlex

## What
Benchmark mooring analysis results between AQWA and OrcaFlex. Compare mooring line modelling, tension results, fatigue outputs, and analysis workflows across both software packages.

## Why
Mooring analysis is critical for floating system integrity. Benchmarking between AQWA and OrcaFlex validates results, highlights tool-specific differences in mooring modelling (catenary vs FE, line dynamics), and supports quality assurance across projects using different tools.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Equivalent mooring system modelled in both AQWA and OrcaFlex
- [ ] Comparison of mooring line tensions (static and dynamic)
- [ ] Comparison of vessel motions with mooring restoring forces
- [ ] Fatigue results comparison (where applicable)
- [ ] Identification of modelling approach differences (catenary, FE, dynamics)
- [ ] Summary report with quantified differences
- [ ] Recommendations on tool selection for mooring analysis
