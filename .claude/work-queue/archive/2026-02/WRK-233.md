# Assess and simplify existing workflows in light of session-analysis self-learning loop

## What

Review all existing workflow documents, skill workflows, and process files against the session-analysis self-learning loop (WRK-231). Identify overlaps, conflicts, and complexity that should be absorbed into the new linear flow. Produce a single, linear flowchart of the entire self-learning system that is the canonical reference — comfortable for the user to follow and trust. Improve workflows where they are fragmented, redundant, or contradict the linear model.

## Why

The session-analysis work (WRK-231) is architecturally sound but the ecosystem has accumulated many overlapping workflow documents — `process.md`, `session-lifecycle.md`, skill workflows, hook documentation, work queue SKILL.md, reflect, improve. A user trying to understand how it all fits together faces a web, not a line. The principle is: **knowledge graphs hold complexity, workflows must be linear**. This item enforces that principle across the whole ecosystem.

Additionally: workflows should be living documents — they should improve as the session-analysis loop produces evidence about where friction occurs. This item sets up the mechanism for that.

## Scope — Existing Workflows to Review

| Document | Location | Likely issue |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Work queue process | `.claude/work-queue/process.md` | May conflict with new agentic horizon gate (WRK-228) |
| Work queue SKILL.md | `.claude/skills/coordination/workspace/work-queue/SKILL.md` | Orchestration wrappers may be superseded by session-analysis |
| Session lifecycle | `.claude/docs/session-lifecycle.md` | Predates WRK-230/231 — needs update |
| Claude reflect | `.claude/skills/coordination/workspace/claude-reflect/SKILL.md` | Overlap with session-analysis — delineate clearly |
| Skill learner | `.claude/skills/coordination/workspace/skill-learner/SKILL.md` | Overlaps with session-analysis skill output — should become a consumer, not a parallel producer |
| Improve skill | `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/improve/SKILL.md` | How does it relate to the self-learning loop? |
| Hooks documentation | `.claude/hooks/` scripts | Fragmented — each hook is standalone, no unified flow |
| Agent composition | `.claude/docs/agent-composition.md` | Does it reflect the Task-tool orchestrator pattern correctly? |
| CLAUDE.md | Root | Does the orchestrator pattern section align with the linear workflow? |

## The Target: One Linear Flowchart

The deliverable is a single document — `.claude/docs/self-learning-workflow.md` — containing:

```
SESSION
  ↓
SESSION-ANALYSIS (WRK-231)
  ↓ routes signals to:
  ├── SKILLS CURATION (WRK-229) ← shallow gaps, low skill scores
  ├── WORK QUEUE ← deep gaps as WRK items
  ├── AGENTIC UPLIFT ← script candidates
  └── PREFLIGHT HOOKS (WRK-226) ← noise, anti-patterns
  ↓
NEXT SESSION — improved context, better skills, gaps queued
  ↓
REPEAT
```

Every existing workflow document should either:
- **Slot into this linear flow** with a clear position and responsibility
- **Be consolidated** into a document that does slot in
- **Be archived** if it's been superseded

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All workflow documents in scope reviewed against the linear model
- [ ] Conflicts and overlaps documented with specific recommendations
- [ ] Each document updated, consolidated, or archived — no orphaned workflows
- [ ] `.claude/docs/self-learning-workflow.md` created: single linear flowchart, plain language, no graph complexity visible
- [ ] `session-lifecycle.md` updated to reflect WRK-230/231 additions
- [ ] `skill-learner` and `claude-reflect` skills updated to clarify their position as consumers/contributors to the session-analysis loop — not parallel systems
- [ ] Workflow improvement mechanism added: session-analysis intervention signals trigger workflow doc reviews (if high friction detected at a workflow step → that doc is flagged for improvement)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Linear workflows are more automatable than web-of-documents workflows — this work directly increases how much of the process an agent can execute without user guidance
- Self-improving workflows (triggered by intervention signals) are a core agentic capability — build the hook now, even if the analysis is simple at first
- **Disposition**: do after WRK-231 — needs the session-analysis loop to be in place before workflows can be assessed against real evidence

Knowledge graphs may capture the complexity but workflows should be linear. Let us add a work item to assess existing workflows and review in light of this session analysis holy grail workflow" + "can we improve workflows?"*
