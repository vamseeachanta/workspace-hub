# Extract offshore vessel fleet data from Offshore Magazine survey PDFs

## What

Extract structured tabular data from two Offshore Magazine survey posters and load into
the `frontierdeepwater` repository under `data/raw/` (PDFs) and `data/processed/`
(structured outputs).

**Source PDFs** (on ace-linux-2, accessible via `/mnt/remote/ace-linux-2/`):

1. `/mnt/remote/ace-linux-2/dde/Temp - Oil&Gas/1111PipelayPoster112711APPads.pdf`
   - *2011 Survey of Worldwide Offshore Pipeline Installation & Burial Contractors & Vessels*
   - Offshore Magazine, November 2011
   - Data: ~60 contractors + vessels; columns include lay method (S-lay/J-lay/reel),
     max water depth (m), pipe diameter range (in), max lay rate, burial capability,
     contact info, vessel photos

2. `/mnt/remote/ace-linux-2/dde/Temp - Oil&Gas/OFF1011HeavyLift-Poster.pdf`
   - *2010 Worldwide Survey of Heavy Lift Vessels*
   - Offshore Magazine, November 2010
   - Data: vessels ≥100t crane capacity; columns include contractor, vessel name,
     crane capacity (t), hook height (m), operating area, vessel dimensions,
     DP class, contact info

## Why

These are industry-standard reference surveys used by offshore engineers to identify
qualified contractors and vessel capabilities for pipeline installation and heavy lift
scopes. Capturing this in structured form enables programmatic querying (e.g. "find all
J-lay vessels capable of 2000m WD") and integration with cost estimation / FEED workflows
in `frontierdeepwater`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Both PDF files copied to `frontierdeepwater/data/raw/offshore-magazine/`
- [ ] Pipelay survey extracted to `data/processed/vessel-fleet/pipelay-contractors-2011.csv`
      (or JSON/YAML) with columns: contractor, vessel, lay_method, max_water_depth_m,
      pipe_dia_min_in, pipe_dia_max_in, lay_rate, burial_capable, flag/region
- [ ] Heavy lift survey extracted to
      `data/processed/vessel-fleet/heavy-lift-vessels-2010.csv` (or JSON/YAML) with
      columns: contractor, vessel, crane_capacity_t, hook_height_m, operating_area,
      vessel_loa_m, vessel_beam_m, dp_class
- [ ] Source metadata file `data/raw/offshore-magazine/README.md` documents provenance
      (source, publisher, date, URL if known)
- [ ] Extraction completeness: ≥90% of data rows captured (poster text is dense;
      partially-legible rows may be flagged as `needs_review: true`)
- [ ] Committed to `frontierdeepwater` with conventional commit message

## Agentic AI Horizon

- Visual table extraction from high-res poster PDFs is increasingly within reach of
  multimodal models — this is a good benchmark task for the pipeline.
- Structured vessel fleet data boosts downstream agentic capability: cost estimators,
  contractor selection agents, and FEED scope tools can query the extracted data
  programmatically rather than requiring a human to read a poster PDF.
- Shape: invest in a clean schema now so future survey updates (2012, 2013, …) can be
  ingested with minimal rework.
