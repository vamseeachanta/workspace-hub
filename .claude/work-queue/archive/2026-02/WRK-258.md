# Close WRK-153 as superseded — defer BSEE case study rebuild to after WRK-019 and WRK-171

## What
Close WRK-153 (re-create the BSEE field economics case study) as superseded by the upcoming cost data foundation (WRK-019) and cost calibration (WRK-171). Add a superseded note to WRK-153 and archive it. Create a replacement item explicitly blocked_by [WRK-019, WRK-171] for the calibrated case study.

## Why
WRK-153 proposes rebuilding a case study that will be far more credible with calibrated cost data. Executing it now produces a proxy-based result that will need to be redone. Better to close it explicitly and create a blocked successor.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WRK-153 archived with a superseded note referencing WRK-019 and WRK-171
- [ ] Replacement WRK item created with blocked_by: [WRK-019, WRK-171] for the calibrated BSEE case study
- [ ] No rework required — the replacement item is the only deliverable beyond the archive action

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Queue hygiene — prevents agents from picking up a low-quality work item when a better-blocked successor exists
- Pure housekeeping; agents can execute the archive action autonomously
- **Disposition: do now** — prevents wasted effort on a proxy-based output; 15-minute task
