# Hull analysis setup skill — chain select, scale, mesh, RAO-link into one call

## What
Create a "hull analysis setup" skill that chains hull library selection (WRK-110), panel scaling to target dimensions (WRK-116), mesh refinement (WRK-117), and RAO linking (WRK-115) into a single agent-callable workflow. Signature: `setup_hull_analysis(target_dimensions) → (scaled_mesh, rao_data)`.

## Why
These four delivered items constitute a complete hull analysis preparation workflow but are separate manual operations. Chaining them makes WRK-043 and WRK-126 (hull-dependent analyses) fully agentisable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Skill chains hull library selection, panel scaling, mesh refinement, and RAO linking
- [ ] Single invocation from target dimensions to (scaled_mesh, rao_data) output
- [ ] Hull library selection returns closest matching hull form (delegates to WRK-255)
- [ ] Tested against 2 hull configurations

## Agentic AI Horizon
- Makes the entire hull analysis preparation workflow autonomous — currently requires manual steps across four separate operations
- All four components are delivered; chaining is the only remaining work
- **Disposition: invest now** — all components done, chaining is the gap; blockers: WRK-255 (hull lookup) should ship first
