# Review, Refine, and Curate Hooks + Skills

## What
Audit all existing hooks (git hooks, Claude Code hooks, shell profile hooks) AND skills (`.claude/skills/`, `/commands/`), research what additional hooks and skills would improve workflows, and curate a clean, documented set across the workspace. Skills define *what* can be done; hooks define *when* it fires — they must be reviewed together.

## Why
Both hooks and skills have accumulated organically — some are useful, some are stale, some overlap, and many skills exist that could be automated via hooks but aren't. A systematic review ensures:
- **No wasted cycles**: remove hooks/skills that fire unnecessarily or are never used
- **Coverage gaps filled**: identify workflow steps that should have hooks but don't, and skills that should exist but are missing
- **Hook-skill alignment**: skills that should auto-trigger via hooks instead of requiring manual invocation
- **Consistency**: same patterns across repos (workspace-hub, worldenergydata, digitalmodel)
- **Discoverability**: developers know what hooks and skills exist and what they do

## Scope

### a/ Audit Existing Hooks
- **Git hooks**: inventory all `.git/hooks/` and `.husky/` across repos (pre-commit, pre-push, commit-msg, etc.)
- **Claude Code hooks**: review `.claude/settings.json` hook definitions (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.)
- **Shell hooks**: any `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` / PowerShell profile integrations
- **CI/CD hooks**: GitHub Actions workflows that act as hooks (on push, on PR, etc.)
- For each hook: document purpose, trigger, execution time, pass/fail rate, value assessment

### b/ Research Best Practices
- Review Claude Code hooks documentation for available hook points and patterns
- Research git hooks best practices (what successful open-source projects use)
- Study existing workspace workflows to identify automation opportunities:
  - Work queue operations (capture, process, archive)
  - Cross-review pipeline triggers
  - Legal compliance scans
  - Test execution gates
  - Submodule pointer sync
- Identify hooks that other AI agent CLIs (codex, gemini) support

### c/ Refine and Curate
- **Keep**: hooks that demonstrably save time or prevent errors
- **Remove**: stale, broken, or redundant hooks
- **Fix**: hooks that exist but have issues (broken paths, slow execution, false positives)
- **Add**: new hooks identified from research that fill workflow gaps
- **Standardize**: consistent hook patterns across repos (naming, error handling, logging)

### d/ Audit and Curate Skills
- **Inventory**: catalog all skills in `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/commands/` across repos
- **Assess each skill**: actively used vs. stale vs. broken vs. redundant
- **Remove**: skills that duplicate built-in functionality or are never invoked
- **Fix**: skills with broken paths, missing dependencies, or outdated references
- **Enhance**: identify skills that should be triggered automatically via hooks (e.g. legal scan skill auto-firing on pre-commit, cross-review skill triggering on PR creation)
- **Align with hooks**: map skills to hook trigger points — which skills should be manual-only, which should have hook triggers, which should support both
- **Skill quality**: ensure each kept skill has clear description, correct metadata in `skills-catalog.json`, and tested functionality

### e/ Document Hook + Skills Catalog
- Create a single catalog document listing all active hooks AND skills
- Per hook: name, type (git/claude/shell/CI), trigger event, what it does, execution time, repo scope
- Per skill: name, category, trigger mode (manual/hook/both), description, repo scope
- Cross-reference: which hooks invoke which skills
- Include setup instructions for new machines (ties into WRK-050 Phase 4)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete inventory of all existing hooks across workspace
- [ ] Complete inventory of all existing skills across workspace
- [ ] Each hook assessed: keep / remove / fix / replace
- [ ] Each skill assessed: keep / remove / fix / enhance
- [ ] Research notes on best practices and opportunities
- [ ] Stale or broken hooks and skills removed
- [ ] New hooks and skills implemented where gaps identified
- [ ] Hook-to-skill alignment documented (which skills auto-trigger via hooks)
- [ ] Combined hook + skills catalog document created
- [ ] All hooks and skills tested and verified working
- [ ] Hooks execute within acceptable time limits (document per-hook targets)

## Technical Notes
- Claude Code hook types: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `SubagentStop`
- Git hook types: `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, `pre-push`, `post-merge`, `post-checkout`
- Known issue: pre-commit hook requires virtualenv (memory note — use `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` bypass)
- Hook path resolution: all hooks should use `$(dirname "$0")` relative paths (fixed 2026-02-08)
- Performance budget: git hooks <3s, Claude hooks <1s, shell startup hooks <2s

## Plan

*To be written — requires research phase first. Start with audit (a/ + d/), then research (b/) will inform what to curate (c/) and document (e/).*

## Closure Note (2026-02-16)

**Closed without execution.** Partially addressed by:
- WRK-094 (workspace workflow improvement — skill lifecycle governance, 28 zombie skills archived)
- WRK-139 (multi-agent orchestration — behavior contract, provider adapters)
- Session-level `/improve` skill addresses ongoing curation

Not re-created because the scope was too broad (11 criteria) and the value has been partially captured by focused items above.
