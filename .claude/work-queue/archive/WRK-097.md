# Implement Three-Tier Data Residence Strategy

## What
Establish formal data governance across worldenergydata and digitalmodel using a three-tier model: Tier 1 (Collection Data) → worldenergydata, Tier 2 (Engineering Reference Data) → digitalmodel, Tier 3 (Project Data) → project repos.

## Why
Engineering data is scattered with no formal boundaries. INVENTORY.md incorrectly claims hull geometry was "gathered from digitalmodel". SN curves are hardcoded in Python. No boundary test exists for where data should live. This creates confusion about data ownership and source of truth.

## Route B Pipeline
```
Explore (audit as-is) → Implement (policy + migrations) → Test (regression) → Archive
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Policy & Documentation
- [x] DATA_RESIDENCE_POLICY.md created at workspace-hub/docs/
- [x] ADR-004 created in knowledge base
- [x] Policy references added to digitalmodel/CLAUDE.md and worldenergydata/CLAUDE.md

### worldenergydata Fixes
- [x] INVENTORY.md provenance corrected (removed "gathered from digitalmodel")
- [x] CLAUDE.md merge conflict resolved, data governance reference added

### digitalmodel Data Externalization
- [x] SN curves externalized to data/fatigue/sn_curves.yaml (37 curves, 4 standards)
- [x] sn_curves.py updated with YAML loader (hardcoded dicts as fallback)
- [x] sn_curve_plotter.py broken path fixed with graceful error handling
- [x] Steel grades copied to data/materials/steel_grades.yaml
- [x] data/README.md created with tier explanation

### Configuration
- [x] config/data_sources.yaml created declaring external data dependencies

### Verification
- [x] 126 pinning tests pass (test_sn_curves_yaml.py)
- [x] 16 existing fatigue migration tests pass (no regressions)

## WRK-096 Coordination
Our changes are data/docs only in worldenergydata. WRK-096 is code-only (Python module restructure). No file conflicts.
