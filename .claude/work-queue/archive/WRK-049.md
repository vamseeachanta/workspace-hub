# Determine dynacard module way forward

## What
Review the current state of the dynacard module in digitalmodel and determine the way forward — whether to continue development, refactor, pivot direction, or deprecate.

## Why
A clear decision on the dynacard module's direction prevents wasted effort and ensures development resources are allocated appropriately. Understanding the current state, gaps, and intended use cases is needed before committing further work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Review current dynacard module state (code, functionality, tests, docs)
- [x] Identify gaps, issues, or blockers
- [x] Assess intended use cases and demand
- [x] Decision documented: continue / refactor / pivot / deprecate
- [x] If continuing: outline next steps and priorities

## Decision: CONTINUE

The dynacard module is feature-complete, well-tested, and architecturally sound. 21 source files, 5,633 LOC, 400 passing tests (317 original + 83 new from P1 coverage work).

### P1 Coverage Improvements (COMPLETED)
| File | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| solver.py | 46% | 90.80% |
| base.py | 45% | 92.70% |
| corners.py | 69% | 91.11% |
| calculations.py | 78% | 98.11% |

### Follow-up Items Created
- WRK-091: Add dynacard module README
- WRK-092: Register dynacard CLI entry point
- WRK-093: Improve AI diagnostics (learning-based classification)
