# Licensed Software Usage Workflow & Burden Reduction

## What
Document OrcaFlex license access workflow (TightVNC, credentials, availability) and review all licensed software (ANSYS, OrcaFlex) for usage optimization and maintenance cost reduction. Fix plaintext credential security violation.

## Why
- Engineers lack a single clear document for "How do I get OrcaFlex running?"
- Plaintext passwords committed to repo (security violation)
- No coordination protocol for shared single-seat license
- No management-facing document for license cost optimization

## Deliverables (ALL COMPLETE)
1. OrcaFlex Usage Guide — `acma-projects/admin/orcaflex/use_instructions.md` + PDF
2. Security fix — removed plaintext passwords from `acma_vpn.md`, `admin.md`, `onboard_tools.md`, `codes_and_standards.md`
3. Remote desktop documentation — `assetutilities/docs/sub_hardware/server_remote_desktop.md`
4. Licensed Software Review — `acma-projects/admin/licensed_software_review.md` + PDF
5. PDF generation script — `acma-projects/admin/generate_pdfs.py`
6. Mermaid conventions skill — `.claude/skills/_internal/documentation/mermaid-conventions/SKILL.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] No plaintext passwords in any committed file (5 files cleaned)
- [x] Each document is standalone (printable/emailable without context)
- [x] All tables use markdown pipe format for clean PDF rendering
- [x] use_instructions.md answers "how do I run OrcaFlex remotely?" end-to-end
- [x] licensed_software_review.md covers OrcaFlex + ANSYS with actionable recommendations
- [x] Way-forward table has owners and timelines for management review
- [x] PDF copies generated (use_instructions.pdf, licensed_software_review.pdf)
- [x] Mermaid diagrams render in PDFs via mermaid.ink API
- [x] Decision nodes follow Yes-left/No-right convention
- [x] Host machine corrected to ACMA-ANSYS05 across all docs
- [x] Committed and pushed to all 3 repos (acma-projects, assetutilities, workspace-hub)

## Commits
- acma-projects: `437653a` — final mermaid convention updates
- assetutilities: `d460f4f` — final mermaid convention updates
- workspace-hub: `2e147b3` — submodule pointer updates + mermaid skill
