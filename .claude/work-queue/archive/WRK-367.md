# assetutilities src/ cleanup — orphaned src/modules/ and src/validators/

## Context
`assetutilities/src/` contains two directories that are NOT part of the installed
`assetutilities` package (which lives under `src/assetutilities/`). They are leftover
from earlier architecture experiments and have no callers in active code.

## Directories to Remove

### 1. `src/modules/` — REMOVE (wrong level, not installed)
Path: `assetutilities/src/modules/`
Contents:
- `agent-os/` (hyphenated) — JS + Python, claude-flow era specs workflow automation
- `agent_os/` (underscore) — Python, duplicate implementation with __pycache__
- `authentication/` — web auth helpers not part of assetutilities API
- `web-contextualization/` — content_indexer.py, pdf_processor.py, example_usage.py

None of these are installed as part of the `assetutilities` package (pyproject.toml
uses `where = ["src"]` with package discovery pointing to `src/assetutilities/`).
No imports from active code (confirmed: grep returns 0 results for `from modules`
or `src.modules` in src/assetutilities/).

### 2. `src/validators/` — REMOVE (left over from WRK-345)
Path: `assetutilities/src/validators/`
Contents: data_validator.py, __init__.py, README.md

WRK-345 consolidated DataValidator into `assetutilities.common.validation` and removed
`worldenergydata/src/validators/`. This parallel copy in assetutilities was missed.
It is NOT part of the installed package (no entry in pyproject.toml packages.find).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `assetutilities/src/modules/` deleted and removed from git
- [ ] `assetutilities/src/validators/` deleted and removed from git
- [ ] `python3 -m pytest tests/ --noconftest -q` still passes (≥285 pass, 0 fail)
- [ ] `pip show assetutilities` still works; package imports normally
- [ ] Commit inside assetutilities, then update hub submodule pointer

## Notes
- Block on WRK-351 (fix test failures) so that post-cleanup test run is clean
- Confirm no import of `from validators` in any test: `grep -r "from validators" tests/ --include="*.py"`
- `src/modules/agent_os/__pycache__/` contains .pyc — these will be deleted with the dir
