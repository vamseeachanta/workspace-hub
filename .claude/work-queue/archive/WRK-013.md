# HSE data analysis — identify typical mishaps by activity and subactivity

## What
Analyze the collected HSE incident data to identify typical mishaps (incident types, frequencies, severities) categorized by activity and subactivity. Build a taxonomy of activities (e.g., drilling, production, installation, maintenance) and subactivities, then map incident patterns to each category.

## Why
Understanding which activities carry the highest incident rates and what types of mishaps are most common enables targeted safety interventions. This analysis forms the analytical backbone for the client-facing risk index (WRK-014).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define activity and subactivity taxonomy for HSE data
- [x] Classify incidents by activity/subactivity across all data sources
- [x] Identify top mishap types per activity category
- [x] Calculate frequency and severity distributions
- [x] Identify patterns and correlations (e.g., seasonal, geographic, equipment-related)
- [x] Produce summary tables and visualizations
- [x] Document methodology and assumptions
- [x] Validate findings against known industry benchmarks where possible

## Progress

**Completed 2026-02-02**

### Deliverables
1. **Activity Taxonomy** - 14-category classification system covering offshore, maritime, pipeline, and industrial operations
2. **Cross-Source Analysis** - 425K+ incidents analyzed from BSEE (1,985), OSHA (420K), marine safety, PHMSA, EPA TRI
3. **Incident Classification** - BERT-based classifier deployed to categorize incidents by activity type
4. **Comprehensive Report** - Full analysis document with findings, visualizations, and recommendations

### Key Findings
- **Offshore**: Personnel safety (37.3%) and process safety (22.4%) dominate
- **Maritime**: Marine transport (43.2%) leads, followed by port operations (18.7%)
- **Pipeline**: Gas distribution deadliest (85 fatalities/100K incidents), hazardous liquids most frequent
- **OSHA**: Falls (33.4%), struck-by (19.6%), and caught-in/between (11.8%) are top hazards
