# worldenergydata root cleanup — modules/, validators/, tests/agent_os/

## Context
Three vestigial directories remain in worldenergydata after WRK-344/345 cleanup. None are
imported by the active Python package.

## Directories to Remove

### 1. `modules/` at repo root
Path: `worldenergydata/modules/`
Contents:
- `automation/` — 3 old shell scripts (agent_orchestrator.sh, gate_pass_review.sh,
  update_ai_agents_daily.sh) — claude-flow/ruv-swarm era automation
- `config/` — ai-agents-registry.json, workflow-templates.json — stale
- `reporting/` — plotly_report_template.py, path_utils.py — outdated

Not imported anywhere in `src/worldenergydata/`. Predates `.claude/skills/` architecture.

### 2. `src/validators/` (empty)
Path: `worldenergydata/src/validators/`
Contents: only `__pycache__/` — no Python source files remain.
Was the standalone DataValidator package; source was moved to
`assetutilities.common.validation` in WRK-345 but this empty shell was left.

### 3. `tests/agent_os/`
Path: `worldenergydata/tests/agent_os/`
Contents: `test_agent_framework.py`
agent_os was removed from assetutilities (WRK-344) but this test directory was not
purged from worldenergydata at the time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `worldenergydata/modules/` deleted and removed from git
- [ ] `worldenergydata/src/validators/` deleted and removed from git
- [ ] `worldenergydata/tests/agent_os/` deleted and removed from git
- [ ] `python3 -m pytest tests/ --noconftest -q` still passes (no regressions)
- [ ] Commit in worldenergydata, then update hub submodule pointer

## Notes
- Verify no import of `from validators` or `from worldenergydata.validators` in active code
  before deleting (confirmed absent in triage — grep returned 0 results)
- `tests/_archived/legacy/agent_os/` can remain as historical archive
