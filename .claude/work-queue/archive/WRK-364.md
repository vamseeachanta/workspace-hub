# Delete Windows-path directory artifacts in digitalmodel and worldenergydata

## Context
Two repos contain a literal directory named with a Windows path string — created when a
script ran on Windows and wrote a path as a folder name instead of resolving it.

## Artifacts to Remove

### digitalmodel
```
/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/digitalmodel/D:\workspace-hub\digitalmodel\docs\charts\phase2\ocimf
```
(0 bytes, confirmed Feb 16 2025)

### worldenergydata
```
/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/worldenergydata/D:\workspace-hub\digitalmodel\docs\charts\phase2\ocimf
```
(0 bytes, confirmed Feb 19 2025)

## Fix

```bash
# In each repo:
git rm -r --cached "D:\workspace-hub\digitalmodel\docs\charts\phase2\ocimf"
rm -rf "D:\workspace-hub\digitalmodel\docs\charts\phase2\ocimf"
git commit -m "chore: delete Windows-path directory artifact"
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No directory with backslash characters exists at root of digitalmodel
- [ ] No directory with backslash characters exists at root of worldenergydata
- [ ] Both repos committed and clean (`git status` shows no `D:\` entries)

## Notes
- These are 0-byte directories — no data loss
- Root cause: a Windows-environment script wrote a path literal as a folder name
- Check assethold root for similar artifacts (tests\modules\stocks\... entries visible in git status)
