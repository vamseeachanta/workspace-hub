# Asset integrity / fitness-for-service (FFS) engineering skill

## What

Create a new `engineering/asset-integrity/` skill category with a Fitness-for-Service (FFS)
assessment skill. FFS methodology (governed by API 579-1/ASME FFS-1) enables operators to
move beyond visual inspections and thickness checks to engineering-based answers on whether
corroded or damaged equipment can continue operating safely.

Gap: current engineering skills cover cathodic-protection (prevention) and risk-assessment
(probabilistic), but have no FFS/damage-assessment capability bridging inspection data to
run-repair-replace decisions.

## Why

2H Offshore (LinkedIn, 2024): "modern fitness-for-service assessments help operators move
beyond uncertainty, providing clear engineering-based answers on whether assets can continue
operating safely." Key driver: visual checks + thickness measurements alone are insufficient
for decision-making on corroded offshore critical assets.

FFS is a core workflow in:
- Offshore platform life extension decisions
- Subsea pipeline integrity management
- Pressure vessel and piping re-rating
- Late-life asset optimisation (cost vs. safety vs. reliability)

Existing skills `cathodic-protection` and `risk-assessment` are prerequisites but do not
cover the FFS assessment loop itself.

## Key Concepts to Implement

### Assessment Levels (API 579-1/ASME FFS-1)
- Level 1: Screening — conservative equations, minimal inspection data required
- Level 2: Detailed — more refined analysis using actual thickness profiles
- Level 3: Advanced — FEA, fracture mechanics, fitness-specific material data

### Damage Mechanisms Covered
- General metal loss (uniform corrosion)
- Local metal loss (pitting, grooves, weld-zone corrosion)
- Crack-like flaws (stress corrosion cracking, fatigue cracks)
- Dents and mechanical damage (offshore impact / dropped objects)
- High-temperature damage (creep, hydrogen embrittlement)

### Core Calculations
- Remaining Strength Factor (RSF): `RSF = actual_t / required_t_for_full_pressure`
- MAWP re-rating: adjusted maximum allowable working pressure based on measured thickness
- Remaining life: corrosion-rate projection to next inspection or end-of-life
- CTP (Critical Thickness Profile): minimum thickness envelope from inspection grid

### Inspection Data Integration
- Ultrasonic thickness (UT) measurement grids
- Phased array UT (PAUT) for weld zones
- Visual inspection classifications (API 510, API 570)
- Corrosion rate extrapolation from historical thickness records

### Run-Repair-Replace Framework
- Run: continue with monitoring plan and reduced MAWP if RSF > RSF_allowable
- Repair: weld overlay, clamp, composite wrap — restore wall thickness
- Replace: spool replacement, re-pipe when repair is impractical or uneconomical

### Standards and Codes
- API 579-1 / ASME FFS-1 (primary)
- API 510 (pressure vessel inspection)
- API 570 (piping inspection)
- DNV-RP-G101 (risk-based inspection for offshore topside)
- NACE SP0502 (pipeline external corrosion direct assessment)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `engineering/asset-integrity/fitness-for-service/SKILL.md` created
- [ ] Covers all 3 API 579 assessment levels with worked examples
- [ ] RSF calculation implemented in Python helper (numpy-based, no extra deps)
- [ ] Remaining life projection function (linear and power-law corrosion models)
- [ ] Inspection data ingestion: accepts UT grid as CSV, outputs CTP map
- [ ] Run-repair-replace decision tree documented
- [ ] `see_also:` links to `cathodic-protection`, `risk-assessment`, `structural-analysis`
- [ ] At least 10 unit tests covering RSF edge cases and life calculations
