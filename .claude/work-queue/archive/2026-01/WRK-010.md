# Rerun lower tertiary analysis with latest/updated BSEE data

## What
After confirming repeatability (WRK-009), rerun the lower tertiary field analysis using the latest/updated BSEE data. Prepare updated lower tertiary results and validate correctness by comparing against historical results.

## Why
Updated data may include new production records, revised figures, or additional fields. The updated results need to be validated against historical baselines to ensure correctness and catch any data anomalies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Obtain latest/updated BSEE data for lower tertiary fields
  - OGOR 2025 data extends through Nov 2025; Oct 2025 used as cutoff (4,019 complete records)
- [x] Rerun the analysis pipeline with updated data
  - Parameterized `reproduce_v30_production(end_date="2025-10-31")` extends window to Oct 2025
  - WTI prices extended Aug-Oct 2025 via EIA GitHub CSV ($64.86, $63.96, $60.89)
- [x] Prepare lower tertiary results output
  - `latest_runner.py` orchestrates production + revenue computation for all 7 producing fields
  - Total cumulative oil across all fields: 708.5M BBL (up from 669.4M in V30)
- [x] Compare against historical results for correctness checks
  - `compare_against_v30()` computes per-field oil and revenue deltas
  - V30 regression: 12/12 tests pass (no regression from parameterization)
- [x] Flag any significant deviations with explanations
  - 3 deviations flagged (>5%): Big Foot (+7.93%), Anchor (+96.80%), Shenandoah (+156,961%)
  - All explained by continued/ramping production, no data anomalies
- [x] Document data vintage and any changes from rev30 inputs
  - Report: `reports/lower_tertiary/wrk010_latest_data_report.md`
  - Baseline: `config/analysis/lower_tertiary/latest_baseline.yml`

## Results Summary

| Development | V30 Oil (BBL) | Latest Oil (BBL) | Delta % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Jack St Malo | 406,571,771 | 421,032,342 | +3.56% |
| Stones | 83,657,789 | 86,326,766 | +3.19% |
| Julia | 70,936,158 | 74,028,262 | +4.36% |
| Big Foot | 66,870,656 | 72,174,604 | +7.93% |
| Cascade Chinook | 34,322,807 | 35,330,558 | +2.94% |
| Anchor | 6,912,846 | 13,604,598 | +96.80% |
| Shenandoah | 3,784 | 5,943,207 | +156,961% |

## Test Verification (49/49 passed)

- `test_repeatability_v30.py`: 12/12 (no regression)
- `test_wti_prices.py`: 7/7
- `test_extended_production.py`: 22/22
- `test_latest_runner.py`: 8/8
