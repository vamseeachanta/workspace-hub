# Add Heavy Construction/Installation Vessel Data

## What
Create a data module in worldenergydata for heavy construction and installation vessels (crane vessels, pipelay vessels, heavy-lift vessels, etc.) with fleet inventory data suitable for offshore engineering use.

## Why
Heavy construction and installation vessels are critical for offshore project planning and engineering analysis. Having a structured dataset of vessel capabilities (crane capacity, deck space, pipelay tension, vessel dimensions, operational limits) enables quick lookup and comparison for feasibility studies and installation engineering.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data schema for heavy construction/installation vessels (dimensions, crane capacity, deck area, operational limits, etc.)
- [ ] Fleet data sourced from publicly available vessel databases
- [ ] Data loader with query capabilities (by vessel name, type, capacity range)
- [ ] Storage format consistent with existing worldenergydata patterns
- [ ] Unit tests for data loading and schema validation

## Plan

**Target**: `src/worldenergydata/vessel_fleet/construction/` (integrate with existing `vessel_fleet/` module — no `vessels/` directory exists)

### Phase 1 — Data Schema
- `vessel_schema.py` — Pydantic model:
  - Identity: name, IMO, operator, flag, year_built, `previous_names: list[str]` (for vessels that have been renamed)
  - Data lineage: `source` field, `confidence_rating` per record
  - Dimensions: LOA, beam, draft, displacement, deck_area_m2
  - Crane: main_crane_capacity_te, aux_crane_capacity_te, crane_reach_m, revolving_capacity
  - Pipelay: pipelay_tension_te, max_pipe_diameter, lay_method (S-lay, J-lay, reel)
  - Operations: DP_class, max_water_depth_m, max_seastate_hs
  - Status: operational, under_construction, retired

### Phase 2 — Data Collection
- Define exact public sources and confirm usage rights before scraping/compiling
- Source from: operator fleet pages, Offshore Engineer magazine, public class records, maritime registries
- Key operators: Heerema, Allseas, Saipem, Subsea 7, McDermott, DEME
- **Scope**: Start with top 20 well-documented vessels, expand iteratively. Phase 2 is primarily manual research — estimate 30-40 hours for 50+ vessels.
- Specify how inconsistent operator data will be resolved (e.g., conflicting crane capacity figures from different sources)
- Target: 50-100 major construction vessels worldwide (stretch goal)

### Phase 3 — Data Loader & Query
- `vessel_loader.py` — Query by name, type, capacity range, DP class
- CSV/Parquet storage consistent with worldenergydata patterns
- Integration with data catalog

### Phase 4 — Tests
- Schema validation, loader tests, query tests

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MAJOR | Gemini: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - Fixed target path from `vessels/construction/` to `vessel_fleet/construction/` (existing module)
  - Added `previous_names` field for vessels that have been renamed
  - Added data lineage field and confidence rating per Codex feedback
  - Reduced initial scope: start with top 20 vessels, expand iteratively
  - Added realistic data collection effort estimate (30-40 hours for 50+ vessels)
  - Added data source conflict resolution strategy
  - Added usage rights verification step
