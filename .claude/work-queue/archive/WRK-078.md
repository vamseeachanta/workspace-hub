# Create energy data case study — BSEE field economics with NPV/IRR workflow

## What
Write a case study for the website showing a BSEE field economics analysis using the NPV/IRR workflow with real (anonymized) data. Follow the existing case study HTML pattern established by the 4 engineering case studies.

## Why
The website has 4 engineering case studies but zero energy data case studies. This is a major sales gap — prospects in the energy data vertical have no proof points to evaluate.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Case study HTML page in case-studies/ directory
- [ ] Follows existing case study HTML/CSS pattern
- [ ] Shows real BSEE production data analysis workflow
- [ ] Includes NPV/IRR calculation results
- [ ] Metrics section with quantified results (time savings, accuracy)
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data
- [ ] Linked from energy.html and case-studies/index.html

## Plan

**Target**: `aceengineer-website/case-studies/`

### Existing Assets (reuse)
- 4 existing engineering case studies (HTML template pattern)
- `analysis/financial/` — NPV, cash flow, drilling cost modules in worldenergydata
- `mv_productionsum.bin` — materialized production data for real analysis

### Phase 0 — Audit Financial Modules
- Audit `src/worldenergydata/bsee/analysis/financial/` to confirm NPV/IRR/cash flow modules exist and are functional
- If modules are stubs or incomplete, scope Phase 1 to only what is available
- Add reproducibility note: document script location and command to regenerate all results

### Phase 1 — Run Analysis
- Select a well-known GoM field (e.g., Thunder Horse or Mars — public BSEE data)
- Use field name and public BSEE data only. Do not reference operator-specific information beyond what BSEE publishes.
- Run production analysis via `ProductionAPI12Analysis`
- Run NPV/IRR calculation via `analysis/financial/` module
- Capture results: production curves, NPV, IRR, payback period

### Phase 2 — Write Case Study
- `case-studies/bsee-field-economics.html`:
  - Follow existing case study HTML/CSS pattern (Bootstrap 3.x)
  - Sections: Challenge, Solution, Results, Methodology
  - Charts: export as static PNG images (not inline Plotly JS — 3MB+ page overhead). Include descriptive alt text for accessibility.
  - Metrics section: use defensible, measured metrics (e.g., "NPV calculated for Z wells in Y seconds") — avoid unverifiable claims like "Reduced analysis time from X weeks to Y hours"
  - JSON-LD structured data for SEO

### Phase 3 — Integration
- Link from `energy.html` featured case studies section
- Add to `case-studies/index.html` grid
- Update sitemap if exists

### Phase 4 — Review
- Verify no client-specific data in case study (use public BSEE data only)
- Legal scan: `scripts/legal/legal-sanity-scan.sh --repo=aceengineer-website`

### Review Notes
- **Verdict**: Claude: MINOR | Codex: MINOR | Gemini: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - Added Phase 0 to audit financial modules exist and are functional before proceeding
  - Mandated static PNG images instead of inline Plotly JS for page performance
  - Replaced unverifiable metrics with defensible, measured metrics
  - Added operator-data constraint: use public BSEE data only, no operator-specific info
  - Added reproducibility note (script location/command) per Codex feedback
