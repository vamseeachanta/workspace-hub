# Create repo-structure skill — canonical source layout for all tier-1 repos

## What
Create `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/repo-structure/SKILL.md` as the authoritative
reference for source code layout, test mirroring, root directory cleanliness, gitignore
compliance, and agent infrastructure rules across all workspace-hub tier-1 repos.

## Why
Post-WRK-344–367 cleanup surfaced recurring patterns of structural drift:
- Orphaned dirs at `src/` root (src/modules/, src/validators/)
- Windows-path directory artifacts
- Vestigial `.agent-os/` and `agents/` root dirs
- Missing `__init__.py` in module dirs
- Loose `.py` scripts at repo root
- Build artifacts committed (htmlcov/, coverage.json, .venv/)

Agents need a single invocable reference (`/repo-structure`) to self-check compliance
before and after making structural changes. This complements `/file-taxonomy` (output
file placement) with source layout rules.

## Scope
- New skill: `.claude/skills/workspace-hub/repo-structure/SKILL.md`
- Tier classification table (Python package / Admin+tooling / Client+portfolio)
- Canonical src/ layout with rules
- Root directory allowed/not-allowed tables
- Gitignore compliance list
- Agent infrastructure single-location rule
- Compliance quick-check bash snippet

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] SKILL.md created at correct path
- [x] Tier table covers all 13 submodule repos
- [x] Root directory "not allowed" table includes all patterns found in WRK-364–367
- [x] Compliance quick-check is executable bash (no pseudo-code)
- [x] `see_also: [file-taxonomy]` cross-reference present
- [x] Under 200 lines (soft target for skills)

## Notes
- Skill is documentation only — no code changes required
- file-taxonomy covers OUTPUT placement; repo-structure covers SOURCE layout
- Client/portfolio repos exempt — clearly called out in tier table
