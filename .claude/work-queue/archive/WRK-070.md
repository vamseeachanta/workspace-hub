# Import PHMSA pipeline data and build pipeline_safety module

## What
Extract the already-downloaded PHMSA ZIP files (24MB pipeline safety flagged incidents + 12 Excel files). Build the pipeline_safety module with database models and importers. Import data covering gas distribution, gas transmission, hazardous liquids, and LNG incidents.

## Why
Pipeline safety data is downloaded but sits unprocessed. The pipeline_safety module is an empty scaffold.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extract PHMSA ZIP files
- [ ] Design pipeline incident database model
- [ ] Build PHMSA importer
- [ ] Import all pipeline incident data (1986-present)
- [ ] Document record counts by pipeline type
- [ ] Populate the pipeline_safety module scaffold

## Progress
- 2026-02-01: Pipeline safety module built from scratch — database model (PipelineIncident), importer (PHMSAImporter), and package structure. 21,003 PHMSA records successfully imported across 4 pipeline types (gas distribution: 4,864, gas transmission: 4,260, hazardous liquid: 11,831, LNG: 48). Data spans 1986-present from 10 Excel files.
