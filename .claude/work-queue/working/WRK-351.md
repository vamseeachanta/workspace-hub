# Assign workstation to all pending/working/blocked WRK items + bake into planning workflow

## What

1. **Retroactive**: For every pending, working, and blocked WRK item that lacks a `computer:`
   field (or has it blank), assign the appropriate workstation using the routing rules from
   the workstations SKILL.md.
2. **Forward-looking**: Update the work-queue SKILL.md so that workstation assignment is a
   named step in the **Capture** and **Plan gate** workflows — confirmed before plan approval.
3. **Index column**: Add a `Computer` column to `INDEX.md` (via `generate-index.py`) so
   machine assignment is visible at a glance.

## Why

Multi-machine awareness is partially implemented (the `computer:` field and routing rules
exist) but not yet enforced. ~128 pending items lack a machine assignment, making it
impossible to know at a glance which machine should run what. Formalising this during
planning prevents misrouted execution and enables multi-machine handoff tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All pending items have a non-blank `computer:` value (or explicitly `machine-agnostic`)
- [ ] All working and blocked items have a non-blank `computer:` value
- [ ] `generate-index.py` emits a `Computer` column in the Master Table
- [ ] INDEX.md regenerated with `Computer` column populated
- [ ] work-queue SKILL.md documents workstation assignment in the Capture phase and Plan gate
- [ ] Template frontmatter in SKILL.md includes `computer:` with routing hint comment

## Agentic AI Horizon

Machine-routing awareness makes future agent dispatching (spawning subagents on the right
machine) tractable. This groundwork pays off quickly as multi-machine orchestration matures.

*Source: /work add for all work items in /work and knowing the workstations available, assign an appropriate workstation to work each work item. This should happen for pending (and future) items. For future work item, this should happen during work planning stage prior to approval*
