# ROADMAP: Repo ecosystem 3-6 month horizon — plan and gear for agentic AI maturation

## Mission

Plan the full repo ecosystem for the next 3–6 months with agentic AI maturation as the primary forcing function. Not "what work needs doing" — that is the work queue's job. This is: **what should the ecosystem look like by August 2026, and what investments today make that possible?**

## Context

The agentic AI landscape is on a steep trajectory. By mid-2026:
- Agents will run longer, more reliably, with less context loss
- Multi-agent coordination will be native, not orchestrated manually
- Model quality for code, reasoning, and planning will be significantly higher
- MCP and plugin ecosystems will be mature enough to depend on
- Autonomous background work (research, curation, gap surfacing) will be reliable

Every repo in the ecosystem either positions us to exploit that trajectory or will become a maintenance burden. This roadmap makes the call on each.

## What This Item Does

1. **Assesses each repo** — current state, strategic value, agentic readiness
2. **Maps the 3–6 month trajectory** — for each repo: where should it be by August 2026?
3. **Identifies investment themes** — the 3–5 things that compound most over this period
4. **Prioritises the work queue** — which of the 200+ pending WRK items are on the critical path to the horizon? Which can be deferred or dropped?
5. **Defines what "done" looks like** — clear criteria for what a well-geared, agentically-ready repo looks like by August 2026
6. **Updates monthly** — the landscape shifts; the roadmap should too

## Repo Ecosystem Assessment (to be done as first phase)

For each repo in workspace-hub, assess against:

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|
-----------|
| **Strategic value** | Does this repo produce output the ecosystem depends on? Is it customer-facing? |
| **Agentic readiness** | Can an agent work in it reliably today? Tests? Clean structure? Good skills coverage? |
| **3-6 month trajectory** | Will agents be doing most of the work here by August 2026? What needs to be true for that? |
| **Investment priority** | High: compound value, agentic-ready path clear. Low: niche, manual, no leverage. |
| **WRK items in queue** | How many pending items? Are they aligned with the trajectory or legacy work? |

**Repos to assess:**
`digitalmodel`, `worldenergydata`, `assethold`, `assetutilities`, `aceengineer-website`, `aceengineer-admin`, `achantas-data`, `frontierdeepwater`, `doris`, `saipem`, `sd-work`, `rock-oil-field`, `OGManufacturing`, `acma-projects`, `seanation`, `pdf-large-reader`, `pyproject-starter`, `teamresumes`, `hobbies`, `sabithaandkrishnaestates`

## AI Agent Readiness Assessment

Alongside repos, assess each AI provider against the 3–6 month horizon:

| Provider | Role today | 3–6 month trajectory | Strategic question |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
--------------------|
| **Claude** | Orchestrator, primary executor | Models improving rapidly; agentic capabilities expanding | Is Claude alone sufficient by August 2026? |
| **Codex** | Cross-review hard gate, code-focused work | OpenAI agentic direction evolving; Codex CLI maturing | Still worth the overhead of maintaining a second provider? |
| **Gemini** | Research, summarisation, Gemini CLI | Google's agentic roadmap accelerating | Unique capability or duplication of Claude? |

**Key strategic question: should we consolidate to the default tool?**

Maintaining three providers has real cost: separate adapter files, cross-review overhead, routing complexity, quota management across all three. If Claude's capabilities in 3–6 months cover what Codex and Gemini do today, consolidating to one provider simplifies everything dramatically.

Assessment must answer:
- What does each provider do today that Claude cannot?
- Will that gap close by August 2026?
- If consolidating: what breaks? What simplifies?
- If staying multi-provider: is the overhead justified by the capability delta?

Output: a clear **provider strategy** — consolidate / maintain / expand — with rationale and a migration path if consolidating.

## Investment Themes (draft — to be validated in Phase 1)

These are hypotheses about where the highest-leverage investments are over 3–6 months:

1. **Session analysis loop (WRK-234)** — the self-improving engine; everything compounds off this
2. **Engineering module depth** — `digitalmodel`, `worldenergydata`, `assethold` are the technical core; making them agentically-workable is the highest ROI
3. **Skills library quality** — 478 skills, many thin; a smaller, higher-quality library beats a large shallow one
4. **Agentic workflow infrastructure** — hooks, session lifecycle, preflight, uplift pipeline; the scaffolding agents need to work autonomously
5. **Customer-facing repos** — `aceengineer-website` and related; agentic AI should be doing portfolio updates, content, and coordination without manual intervention

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All repos assessed on: strategic value, agentic readiness, 3-6 month trajectory, investment priority
- [x] All AI providers assessed: Claude, Codex, Gemini — current role, trajectory, unique value
- [x] Provider strategy decision: consolidate / maintain / expand — with rationale (Option A: maintain)
- [x] `config/agents/provider-capabilities.yaml` updated with strategy decision + horizon fields
- [ ] `CODEX.md` and `GEMINI.md` adapter files updated or deprecated based on strategy (standing: maintain; no deprecation needed)
- [x] Roadmap document produced: `.claude/docs/roadmap-2026-h1.md` — per-repo status, investment themes, critical-path WRK items
- [x] Work queue re-prioritised: top 20 items aligned with roadmap; items that don't contribute to 3-6 month horizon explicitly deprioritised or parked
- [x] "Done" definition written: what does the ecosystem look like in August 2026 if this roadmap succeeds?
- [x] Monthly review cadence established: first Friday of each month, next review 2026-03-06
- [ ] Each repo has an `## Agentic AI Horizon` assessment (WRK-228 gate) — ongoing; per-repo horizon sections to be added as each repo is worked (compound with WRK-234)

## Agentic AI Horizon

*This item IS the agentic AI horizon assessment, at ecosystem scale.*

- The goal is not to complete all current WRK items — it is to arrive at August 2026 with an ecosystem that agents can operate autonomously
- Work that doesn't contribute to that goal should be explicitly deprioritised now, not discovered as wasted effort in 4 months
- **Disposition**: start immediately, in parallel with WRK-234; the roadmap should inform which child items of WRK-234 to prioritise
