# ABS standards acquisition: create folder + download CP Guidance Notes

## What

No `ABS/` folder exists in `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/`. Existing ABS PDFs are mislabelled under
`BSI/`. ABS Guidance Notes for Ships (Dec 2017) is only in `acma-projects/`; ABS Guidance Notes
for Offshore Structures (Dec 2018) is only at eagle.org (public, free download).

## Why

WRK-269 (CP standards research) depends on having authoritative ABS documents available in the
standards archive. Fixing the mislabelling and downloading missing docs unblocks that research.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/ABS/` created with sub-folders: `Guidance-Notes/`, `Rules/`, `Notices/`
- [x] Existing ABS PDFs moved from `BSI/` to `ABS/` with correct names (4 files: GUI-000, GUI-002, GUI-115×2)
- [ ] ABS GN Ships (Dec 2017) — **NOT FOUND** in acma-projects; manual download required from eagle.org
- [ ] ABS GN Offshore Structures 2018 (GUI-239) — **network blocked**; manual download required
  - URL: `https://ww2.eagle.org/content/dam/eagle/rules-and-guides/current/other/239_cathodic_protection_offshore_structures/guide_cathodic_protection_offshore_structures.pdf`
- [x] `INDEX.md` created at `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/ABS/INDEX.md` with URLs for manual downloads
- [ ] `/mnt/ace/docs/DISCIPLINE_INDEX.md` — not an applicable index for standards bodies; n/a
- [x] No ABS files remain under `BSI/`
- [ ] WRK-269 CP standards research — partially unblocked; 2 CP GN docs still need manual download
- [ ] **Follow-up**: migrate unprocessed ABS docs from `/mnt/ace/O&G-Standards/raw/0000 Codes & Standards/ABS/`
  (sub-folders: ABS 00, 002, 057, 101, 104, 115, 123)

## Agentic AI Horizon

- File organisation and public-domain downloads are ideal for agentic execution.
- Once the ABS folder is established, future CP standards can be systematically acquired
  by an agent scanning eagle.org release pages.
