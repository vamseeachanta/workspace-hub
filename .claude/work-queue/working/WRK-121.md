## Description
Extract ~235 OrcaFlex .dat models from rock-oil-field/s7/, sanitize client references, convert to YAML, organize into library categories (jumper, installation, mooring, training), generate spec.yml for each model group, validate round-trip via 3-way benchmark.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Sanitization script: `scripts/sanitize_s7_models.py`
- [ ] Spec extraction script: `scripts/extract_s7_specs.py`
- [ ] Legal deny list: `digitalmodel/.legal-deny-list.yaml`
- [ ] Sanitized models in `docs/modules/orcaflex/{jumper,installation,mooring,training}/`
- [ ] spec.yml for each model group
- [ ] Jumper analysis skill: `.claude/skills/orcaflex-jumper-analysis/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Legal sanity scan skill: `.claude/skills/legal-sanity-scan/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Legal scan passes (exit code 0)
- [ ] Round-trip validation on jumper + mooring models

## Progress
- 2026-02-11: Plan approved. Scripts and skills creation in progress.
