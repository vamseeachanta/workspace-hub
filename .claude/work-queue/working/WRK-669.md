# test(review): orchestrator gate run with Claude

## Problem

CLAUDE.md and WRK-656 demand validator-friendly evidence that Claude acting as orchestrator actually executes every WRK-624 gate before claiming implementation. WRK-657 provided metadata, but we still need a dedicated run proving the stage logs, plan HTML, cross-review artifacts, TDD output, legal scan, and validator are wired together.

## What

Execute a full `/work` session where Claude is explicitly the orchestrator. Capture the stage logs (plan → cross-review → TDD → legal → close), reuse the WRK-657 artifacts where needed, and feed everything through `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py` so the orchestrator contract is satisfied.

## Plan

### Phase 1 — Prepare artifacts

- copy or reference the WRK-657 plan HTML, review summary, claim-evidence template, and variation-test results so the prompt/context is stable.
- ensure the WRK-669 assets directory (`assets/WRK-669/`) exists before executing the run; plan to record plan, review, TDD, legal, and claim-evidence outputs there.

### Phase 2 — Run Claude orchestrator session

- start `/work run` targeting WRK-669, letting Claude orchestrate plan, cross-review (Claude + Codex/Gemini), TDD, and legal stages.
- capture stage logs (start, plan, cross-review, close) under `.claude/work-queue/logs/WRK-669-*.log`.
- ensure Claude writes a claim-evidence pack and review artifacts plus plan HTML (with human confirmation element).

### Phase 3 — Validate

- run `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-669` and stash the output in `assets/WRK-669/claim-evidence.yaml`.
- generate a summary HTML (modelled after `assets/WRK-659/wrk-659-claude_orchestrator-summary.html`) describing per-stage passes, skipped sections, and log references.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/work run` produces plan HTML, cross-review artifact, variation test results, legal scan, and claim-evidence under `assets/WRK-669/`.
- [ ] Stage logs exist for start, plan, cross-review, and close.
- [ ] `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-669` returns exit 0 and references the claim-evidence pack.
- [ ] Summary HTML describes why any resource-intelligence/user-final-review stages were skipped and documents the human review confirmation link/button.

## Evidence

- `assets/WRK-669/plan-html-review-final.md`
- `assets/WRK-669/review.html`
- `.claude/work-queue/logs/WRK-669-*.log`
- `scripts/work-queue/verify-gate-evidence.py WRK-669` output

## Outcome

Claude has a reproducible gate run that proves the orchestrator adheres to WRK-656’s contract; future verdicts can reference this artifact bundle to validate other orchestrators.
