# OrcaFlex Module Roadmap — Evolving Coordination

## What
Living roadmap tracking all OrcaFlex-related work items across the digitalmodel repository. This item is updated as individual tasks are completed, new items are discovered, or priorities shift. The artifact is `specs/modules/orcaflex-work-routing.md`.

## Why
With 23+ OrcaFlex work items spanning modular generation, hull infrastructure, diffraction benchmarking, analysis capabilities, and data collection, a single coordination document prevents duplication, ensures correct sequencing, and makes progress visible.

## How This Item Works
- **Not a task to "complete"** — this stays `in_progress` as long as OrcaFlex work continues
- **Updated per-session**: When any OrcaFlex WRK item changes status, update the routing document
- **Reviewed monthly**: Full re-assessment of priorities, dependencies, and phase progression
- **Artifact**: `specs/modules/orcaflex-work-routing.md` (the routing analysis)

## Current Phase Summary (2026-02-11)

| Phase | Status | Key Items |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 0: Housekeeping | Partial | WRK-100 needs archive move |
| 1: Foundation | Active | WRK-121 in-progress, WRK-051/064 ready |
| 2: Infrastructure | Ready | WRK-032/044/101/106/116 unblocked |
| 3: Hull Expansion | Waiting | Depends on Phase 2 (WRK-106) |
| 4: Analysis | Waiting | Depends on WRK-121 completion |
| 5: Advanced | Future | Depends on Phase 2-4 |
| 6: Data Collection | Anytime | WRK-102/103/105 independent |
| 7: Benchmarking | Waiting | WRK-126/127/128 need review |

## Plans Needing Review
- WRK-110 (hull library expansion) — not cross-reviewed
- WRK-115 (RAO-hull linking) — not cross-reviewed
- WRK-116 (mesh scaling) — target path incorrect, not cross-reviewed
- WRK-117 (mesh refinement) — not cross-reviewed
- WRK-126 (benchmark all models) — not cross-reviewed
- WRK-127 (spec templates) — not cross-reviewed
- WRK-128 (property routing) — not cross-reviewed

## Stale Status Items
- WRK-031: ~75% complete, status says pending
- WRK-032: ~85% complete, status says pending
- WRK-064: ~80% complete, status says pending
- WRK-100: 100% complete, still in pending/

## Risk Summary
- OrcaFlex/ANSYS license gates 6+ items
- `solvers/aqwa/` module doesn't exist (blocks WRK-039)
- No VIV module (blocks WRK-045 Phase 4)
- Test coverage at 2.7%

*This item tracks coordination, not implementation. It stays in_progress indefinitely.*
