# Vision Document — Bridge Current Repo Mission to Autonomous-Production Future

## What

Produce a strategic vision document for the ACE Engineering ecosystem of repositories that
bridges where we are today to the "Agile Adaptive Autonomous Production" future described in
[Zvi Feuer's LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beyond-automation-era-agile-adaptive-autonomous-production-zvi-feuer-gzm0f/).
The deliverable is a single authoritative `docs/vision/VISION.md` in `workspace-hub` that:

1. Articulates the **current mission** of each major repo in plain language
2. Maps each repo's trajectory toward autonomous, adaptive engineering workflows
3. Identifies the **capability gaps** between today and the autonomous-production future
4. Proposes a **3-horizon roadmap** (horizon 1 = now, 2 = 6–18 months, 3 = 18 months+)

Extensive online research is required to:
- Read and synthesise the source article and its cited concepts (Industry 4.0, Digital Twin,
  AI-driven operations, adaptive manufacturing)
- Survey comparable open-source and commercial engineering platforms taking the same journey
- Ground the vision in real industry direction, not just internal aspiration

## Why

The workspace-hub repositories span computational engineering (OrcaFlex, OpenFOAM, FEA),
digital asset management, data pipelines, and AI orchestration. Without an explicit shared
vision, each repo optimises locally. A unified future-state vision lets every WRK item be
evaluated against a north star: _does this move us toward autonomous adaptive production?_

This also serves as a reference for onboarding new contributors and for marketing via
aceengineer-website.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Source article fully read and key concepts extracted (Industry 4.0, Digital Twin, AAAP loop, etc.)
- [ ] Secondary research complete — at least 3 corroborating industry sources surveyed
- [ ] Current-mission summary written for each major repo (digitalmodel, assetutilities, assethold, worldenergydata, aceengineer-website, workspace-hub itself)
- [ ] Capability-gap analysis table completed (current state vs autonomous-production future)
- [ ] 3-horizon roadmap drafted with concrete capability milestones per horizon
- [ ] WRK-item candidates identified for horizon 1 and 2 gaps
- [ ] `docs/vision/VISION.md` created in workspace-hub and committed
- [ ] Vision reviewed and approved by user before commit

## Agentic AI Horizon

- This work **directly enables** the agentic future: the vision document becomes the rubric
  by which every WRK item is prioritised and shaped for maximum future leverage
- The autonomous-production future (self-optimising workflows, adaptive AI agents, real-time
  decision loops) is exactly the direction this ecosystem is building toward (see WRK-372,
  WRK-235 roadmap)
- Writing the vision now shapes every subsequent WRK item; deferring means continued local
  optimisation without a shared north star
- The document itself is groundwork that AI agents will reference when triaging future work
- Disposition: **invest now** — a one-time research effort that creates persistent direction
