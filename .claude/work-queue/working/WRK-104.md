# Expand Drilling Rig Fleet Dataset to All Offshore and Onshore Rigs

## What
Expand the existing rig fleet inventory (currently 16 rigs from WAR data) to include all known offshore and onshore drilling rigs. Source publicly available rig fleet data covering jackups, semisubs, drillships, platform rigs, land rigs, and other rig types worldwide.

## Why
The current fleet dataset only covers 16 rigs from a single source (WAR). A comprehensive fleet covering all offshore and onshore rigs enables fleet-wide analysis, market studies, rig selection for projects, and serves as the foundation for hull data (WRK-102) and engineering analysis workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify and ingest publicly available rig fleet data sources (BSEE, industry registries, etc.)
- [ ] Add all offshore rig types: jackups, semisubs, drillships, tender-assist, platform rigs
- [ ] Add onshore/land rig fleet data
- [ ] Maintain existing schema structure (extend if needed for new rig types)
- [ ] Rig type classification consistent with existing rig_type_overrides.csv pattern
- [ ] Update rig_fleet.bin binary with expanded dataset
- [ ] Data loader returns full fleet with filtering by rig type (offshore/onshore)
- [ ] Unit tests for expanded dataset loading and type classification
