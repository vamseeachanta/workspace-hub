# S7 Script Instrumentation with TrackedQuantity

## What
Wrap real OrcaFlex analysis scripts in `rock-oil-field/s7/` with `TrackedQuantity` and the OrcaFlex adapter from WRK-095 to prove unit tracking works in production use.

## Why
The OrcaFlex adapter was built in WRK-095 but only tested with synthetic data. Instrumenting real S7 scripts validates the adapter handles actual engineering workflows and demonstrates the unit provenance chain in practice.

## Scope
1. Identify 1-2 representative S7 scripts that use OrcaFlex parameters
2. Wrap key numeric inputs with `wrap_orcaflex_value` / `wrap_model_parameters`
3. Add unit tracking through the computation chain
4. Demonstrate audit trail output for a complete analysis run

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] At least one S7 script instrumented with TrackedQuantity
- [x] Unit provenance chain visible from input to output
- [x] No regression in existing script behavior
- [x] Example output showing audit trail
