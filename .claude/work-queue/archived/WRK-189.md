# Daily stock analysis and position strategy for long-term portfolios

## What

Build a daily stock analysis workflow for `assethold` that examines existing long-term portfolio positions
and produces a clear, actionable daily strategy: whether to **build** (add to) or **trim** (reduce) each
position based on fundamental and technical signals.

Live portfolio data lives at:
`/mnt/local-analysis/workspace-hub/achantas-data/_finance/fidelity`

## Why

Long-term investors still benefit from systematic daily review. Markets move; valuations drift; new
information arrives. A repeatable, automated analysis loop removes emotion from the "add vs. trim"
decision and keeps position sizing aligned with conviction and risk tolerance.

## Scope

- Read existing portfolio holdings (from the Fidelity data path above)
- Pull current market data (price, volume, key ratios) via a free data source (yfinance or similar)
- Evaluate each holding against configurable thresholds: valuation (P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA), momentum
  (RSI, moving average position), and portfolio weight drift
- Produce a ranked daily signal: **Strong Build / Build / Hold / Trim / Strong Trim** per ticker
- Output a human-readable daily strategy report (Markdown or terminal table) with supporting rationale
- Schedule or trigger daily (cron-friendly entry point)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Portfolio loader reads Fidelity holdings from `achantas-data/_finance/fidelity` and returns a
      structured list of positions (ticker, shares, cost basis)
- [x] Market data fetcher retrieves current price, volume, P/E, 52-week range, and RSI for each ticker
- [x] Signal engine scores each position and assigns a Build/Hold/Trim recommendation
- [x] Daily report is written to `assethold/reports/daily-strategy/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- [x] CLI entry point: `python -m assethold.analysis.daily_strategy` (or equivalent)
- [x] Unit tests cover signal engine logic with mock market data (136 tests passing)
- [x] README section documents how to run and interpret the daily report
- [x] Insider trend analysis integrated (SEC Form 4 via yfinance, 90-day window)
