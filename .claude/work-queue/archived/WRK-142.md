# Dimension Analysis API for TrackedQuantity

## What
Add `dimensions` property and dimensional consistency check methods to `TrackedQuantity`. Gap #5 identified during WRK-095 planning but deferred from scope.

## Why
Engineers need to inspect and verify the physical dimensions of quantities (e.g., confirm a result is [force]/[length]^2 = pressure) without converting to specific units. This enables dimensional analysis at computation boundaries.

## Scope
1. Add `TrackedQuantity.dimensions` property returning pint dimensionality
2. Add `TrackedQuantity.is_compatible(other)` method for dimension checking
3. Add `TrackedQuantity.check_dimensions(expected)` for assertion-style validation
4. Tests for all three methods

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `.dimensions` property returns human-readable dimensionality
- [x] `.is_compatible(other)` returns bool for dimension match
- [x] `.check_dimensions("pressure")` raises on mismatch
- [x] Tests covering standard and compound dimensions
