## Audit Finding (2026-02-18)

**No merge needed.** The two hierarchies serve completely different roles:

| Path | Role | Content type |
|------|------|--------------|
| `src/assetutilities/modules/` | Python source implementations | `.py` packages imported by engine |
| `src/assetutilities/base_configs/modules/` | YAML config/template defaults | `.yml` files loaded as file paths |

### Evidence

- `engine.py` imports from `assetutilities.modules.csv_utilities`, `.excel_utilities`, etc. (Python packages)
- `visualization_templates_*.py` references `base_configs/modules/visualization/*.yml` as file paths (YAML templates)
- Zero Python imports from `assetutilities.base_configs.*`
- Zero YAML files in `modules/` Python hierarchy

### What looked like "overlap"

`base_configs/modules/csv_utilities/csv_utilities.yml` = runtime default config for the csv_utilities component.
`modules/csv_utilities/csv_utilities.py` = the actual Python implementation.
These are complementary — one configures the other.

### Minor naming inconsistency (cosmetic only)

- `base_configs/modules/yaml_utilities/` — uses `yaml_` prefix
- `modules/yml_utilities/` — uses `yml_` prefix
Not worth fixing as they're in different namespaces and no code confuses them.

## Resolution

Closing as misdiagnosis. Both hierarchies are correct and necessary as-is.
