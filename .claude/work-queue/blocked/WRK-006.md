# Upload videos from iPhone to YouTube

## What
Transfer and upload videos from iPhone to YouTube. Ensure each video has proper titles and descriptions set during the upload process.

## Why
Consolidate video content on YouTube platform for centralized access and sharing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All target videos transferred from iPhone
- [ ] Videos uploaded to YouTube
- [ ] Proper titles and descriptions set for each video

## Plan

- **Step 1**: Transfer videos from iPhone to local machine (AirDrop, USB, or iCloud). Note total count and combined file size. If total exceeds 10 videos, proceed with API path (Step 3a); otherwise, use manual upload (Step 3b)
- **Step 2**: Organize by date/topic; create title and description templates
- **Step 3a**: Use YouTube Data API v3 for batch processing (requires OAuth credentials and Google Cloud project). Be aware of daily upload quota limits (default ~6 videos/day for unverified apps); request quota increase if needed
- **Step 3b**: Manual upload via YouTube Studio if fewer than 10 videos
- **Step 4**: Set privacy settings (unlisted by default until reviewed)
- **Step 5**: Verify uploads and set proper titles/descriptions

### Review Notes

- **Verdict**: Claude: APPROVE
- **Actions taken**:
  - Added decision criteria to Step 1: if >10 videos use API path, otherwise manual upload
  - Split Step 3 into Step 3a (API) and Step 3b (manual) with clear prerequisites
  - Added daily upload quota awareness (default ~6 videos/day) to API path
