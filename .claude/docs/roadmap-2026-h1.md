# Repo Ecosystem Roadmap — 2026 H1
*WRK-235 | Established: 2026-02-20 | Cadence: monthly review (first Friday)*

## Mission

Arrive at August 2026 with an ecosystem where agents can operate the critical-path repos autonomously — sourcing data, running analyses, generating client content, and improving their own capabilities without manual orchestration.

## Standing Decisions

### 1. Provider Strategy — Option A (maintain all three)
- **Claude** — orchestrator and primary executor
- **Codex** — cross-review hard gate for Route B/C
- **Gemini** — research, summarisation, online checks
- **Review trigger**: WRK-237 (provider cost tracking) generates quarterly evidence; decision revisited when data shows clear imbalance in utility vs overhead
- **Skills**: `.claude/skills/` canonical; `.codex/skills` + `.gemini/skills` → symlinks; plugin format explicitly not adopted (WRK-225)

### 2. Critical Path Repos

| Repo | Role | August 2026 target |
|------|------|--------------------|
| `workspace-hub` | Orchestration layer, self-improving loop | Fully autonomous session lifecycle; agents self-improve without nudging |
| `digitalmodel` | Engineering module hub | All major modules (fatigue, wall thickness, FFS, OrcaFlex) agent-callable as skills |
| `worldenergydata` | Data foundation | All data sources queryable by agents; refresh scheduled; skill wrappers complete |
| `assethold` | Financial / daily strategy analysis | Agents run daily strategy autonomously; no manual intervention |
| `aceengineer-website` | Client-facing output | Agents generate and publish content from data + module outputs |

**Maintained (not on critical path)**: `aceengineer-admin`, `frontierdeepwater`, `doris`, `saipem`, `sd-work`

**Parked / deprioritised**: `hobbies`, `sabithaandkrishnaestates`, `rock-oil-field`, `teamresumes`

### 3. The Self-Improving Loop
The instruments generate the detail — no manual repo-by-repo assessment needed:

```
SESSION RUNS
    ↓
SESSION ENDS → session-analysis (WRK-231, 3AM cron)
    ↓
ROUTES TO:
  Skills curation    (WRK-229)
  Gap WRK items      (auto-created)
  Noise / preflight  (WRK-226)
  Candidates         (script / skill / hook / agent / MCP)
    ↓
WEEKLY: agentic-horizon skill reassesses all active items
MONTHLY: this roadmap updated against actual progress
    ↓
NEXT SESSION — better context, better skills, fresh gaps queued
```

What was true of repos in February will surface naturally via this loop. The roadmap doesn't need to predict — it needs to stay out of the way.

## Investment Themes (February 2026)

1. **Session analysis loop** (WRK-231) — the engine; everything compounds off this; in progress
2. **Engineering skill wrappers** (WRK-239–245) — delivered modules not yet agent-callable; highest ROI, low effort; queued
3. **Data queryability** (WRK-246, WRK-252) — data exists, exposure is the gap; queued
4. **Client-facing content** (WRK-246, WRK-248, WRK-250) — marketing assets from existing data; queued
5. **Agentic infrastructure** (WRK-226, WRK-229, WRK-230) — hooks, preflight, session lifecycle; in progress

## Monthly Review Checklist
*(First Friday of each month)*

- [ ] Which critical-path repos advanced? Any blockers?
- [ ] Provider utility check: is Codex/Gemini earning its overhead? (from WRK-237 data)
- [ ] Horizon skill output: any `park` items now `do now`? Any `do now` items now obsolete?
- [ ] New model releases since last review — any standing decisions affected?
- [ ] Work queue health: is queue net-shrinking? (from WRK-231 velocity tracking)

## Done Definition (August 2026)

The ecosystem is on track if:
- An agent can run a complete fatigue or wall thickness assessment end-to-end with one invocation
- Session analysis runs nightly without intervention and surfaces actionable signals
- aceengineer-website content is generated by agents from live data and module outputs
- The work queue is net-shrinking (more items archived per month than created)
- Provider strategy is validated by cost data, not assumption
