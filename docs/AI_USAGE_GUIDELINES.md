## üö® CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT NOTICE

**THIS DOCUMENT IS MANDATORY FOR ALL AI AGENTS AND USERS**

If you (AI agent) detect that the user or another AI is NOT following these guidelines:

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
2. **REFERENCE THIS DOCUMENT** (`docs/AI_USAGE_GUIDELINES.md`)
3. **EXPLAIN THE CORRECT APPROACH** using the effectiveness matrix
4. **DO NOT PROCEED** until user agrees to follow ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê patterns
5. **GUIDE USER BACK** to proper workflow

**Example Enforcement:**

```
‚ùå USER: "Can you describe what run_analysis.sh does?"

‚úÖ AI RESPONSE:
"I notice you're asking me to describe the script (‚≠ê PRETTY BAD effectiveness).
Instead, let me follow the ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê BEST PRACTICE:

1. I'll prepare the YAML input file in config/input/
2. I'll provide you the exact bash command to run
3. You execute the command and we review ACTUAL results

This approach is 90% faster with very low error rate and excellent reproducibility.

See docs/AI_USAGE_GUIDELINES.md for the full effectiveness matrix.

Should I proceed with the correct approach?"
```

## Overview

This document captures learnings and best practices for using AI tools (especially Claude) when working with workspace-hub repositories. It's organized by effectiveness, from best to worst approaches, based on real-world experience.

**COMPLIANCE IS MANDATORY** - All work must follow ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê or ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê patterns.

---

## ‚≠ê Best Practices (Highly Recommended)

### 1. Running Script with AI-Prepared Input File + AI-Provided Command

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **EVEN BETTER** (Highest effectiveness)

**What it is:**
- AI agent prepares the input YAML configuration file
- AI agent provides the exact bash command to execute
- User runs the provided command with the prepared input file

**Why it works best:**
- Complete workflow automation without manual intervention
- AI handles both configuration complexity AND execution syntax
- Reduces human error in both file preparation and command construction
- Follows SPARC methodology (Specification ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Execution)
- Reproducible and auditable (input file + command are version controlled)

**Example:**

```bash
# AI prepares: config/input/lower_tertiary.yaml
# AI provides this command:
./scripts/bsee/run_lower_tertiary_analysis.sh reports/lower_tertiary

# User just copies and runs the command
# Results: Perfect execution with comprehensive output
```

**When to use:**
- Complex analysis workflows with many parameters
- Economic modeling (NPV analysis, production forecasting)
- Multi-source data integration
- Any task requiring both configuration and execution

**Best with:**
- Claude (excellent at understanding context and generating precise commands)
- Any module with YAML configuration support
- Scripts in scripts/ directories across repositories

---

### 2. Git Operations with AI (Especially Claude)

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **GOOD** (Highly effective)

**What it is:**
- Using AI (particularly Claude) to perform git operations
- Branch management, commits, pull requests, merges
- Git workflow orchestration

**Why it works:**
- Claude understands git context extremely well
- Generates proper commit messages following conventions
- Handles complex merge scenarios
- Maintains clean git history

**Example:**

```bash
# Ask Claude to:
# 1. Create feature branch
# 2. Commit changes with meaningful message
# 3. Push to remote
# 4. Create pull request

# Claude executes:
git checkout -b feature/new-analysis-module
git add scripts/ config/input/ docs/
git commit -m "Add comprehensive analysis module

- Multi-source data integration
- Interactive Plotly visualizations
- Bash execution framework
- YAML configuration support"

git push -u origin feature/new-analysis-module
gh pr create --title "New Analysis Module" --body "..."
```

**When to use:**
- Feature branch workflows
- Complex commit scenarios
- Pull request creation
- Repository synchronization
- Merge conflict resolution

**Best with:**
- Claude Code (native git integration)
- Multi-file changes
- Workflow automation
- Repository management tasks

---

### 3. Running Script with Input File

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **GOOD** (Very effective)

**What it is:**
- Running bash scripts with YAML configuration files as input
- User prepares input file (or AI prepares it)
- User manually constructs and runs the command

**Why it works:**
- Separates configuration from execution
- Version-controllable input parameters
- Reproducible analysis workflows
- Clear audit trail

**Example:**

```bash
# Input file: config/input/analysis_config.yaml
# User runs:
./scripts/run_analysis.sh reports/output

# Or with Python directly:
python scripts/analyze_data.py \
    --config config/input/analysis_config.yaml \
    --output reports/analysis \
    --format html \
    --interactive
```

**When to use:**
- Standardized analysis workflows
- Repeatable processing tasks
- When input parameters need version control
- Production-grade analysis runs

**Best with:**
- Any modular analysis workflow
- Scripts with configuration support
- Data processing pipelines

---

### 4. Preparing Input Files

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **GOOD** (Very effective)

**What it is:**
- Using AI to generate YAML configuration files
- Following SPARC workflow templates
- Structured input for bash execution

**Why it works:**
- AI understands YAML structure and validation
- Follows established templates and patterns
- Reduces configuration errors
- Enables complex parameter specification

**Example:**

```yaml
# AI generates: config/input/custom_analysis.yaml

metadata:
  feature_name: "custom-analysis"
  created: "2025-10-22"
  status: "production"

requirements:
  functional:
    - requirement: "Process data with custom parameters"
      priority: "high"
      implemented: true

processing:
  steps:
    - name: "load_data"
      module: "data_loader"
      function: "load_data"
      params:
        validate: true
        encoding: "utf-8"
```

**When to use:**
- New analysis workflows
- Complex configuration requirements
- Parameter-heavy operations
- Any setup with multiple configuration options

**Best with:**
- Claude (excellent YAML generation)
- Template-based configurations
- Multi-parameter scenarios

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Use With Caution

### 5. Running a Script (Standalone)

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **OK BUT...** (Limited effectiveness)

**What it is:**
- Running bash scripts without input files
- Hardcoded parameters or defaults
- Direct script execution

**Why it's limited:**
- Less reproducible (parameters not version controlled)
- Harder to modify parameters
- Limited audit trail
- Difficult to share exact configuration

**Example:**

```bash
# Just running the script
./scripts/run_analysis.sh

# Works, but:
# - Uses default parameters
# - No customization without editing script
# - Hard to reproduce exact conditions
```

**When acceptable:**
- Quick exploratory analysis
- Testing script functionality
- Default parameter runs
- One-off executions

**Better alternative:**
- Prepare input file first
- Use script + input file approach
- Version control your configuration

---

## ‚ùå Avoid These Approaches

### 6. Running LLM Descriptions

**Rating:** ‚≠ê **PRETTY BAD SIDE** (Least effective)

**What it is:**
- Asking AI to describe what a script does
- Using AI to explain code instead of running it
- Theoretical analysis instead of practical execution

**Why it fails:**
- No actual results produced
- Theoretical understanding ‚â† working implementation
- Wastes time on description instead of action
- Doesn't advance the actual work

**Example of what NOT to do:**

```
‚ùå BAD: "Can you describe what analyze_data.py does?"
    Result: Long description, no actionable output

‚úÖ GOOD: "Prepare input file for data analysis and
          provide the command to run it"
    Result: Working configuration + executable command + actual results
```

**Why to avoid:**
- Doesn't produce tangible results
- Time spent on explanation, not execution
- Creates false sense of progress
- Better to just run the code with proper inputs

**Better alternative:**
- Prepare input file + run script
- Let results speak for themselves
- Review actual output instead of descriptions

---

## üéØ Workflow Recommendations

### Recommended Workflow Pattern

```
1. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê AI prepares input YAML file
   ‚îî‚îÄ Following template in templates/input_config.yaml
   ‚îî‚îÄ Validated against schema
   ‚îî‚îÄ Version controlled in config/input/

2. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê AI provides exact bash command
   ‚îî‚îÄ Points to correct script in scripts/
   ‚îî‚îÄ References prepared input file
   ‚îî‚îÄ Includes all necessary flags

3. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê User executes command
   ‚îî‚îÄ Copy/paste provided command
   ‚îî‚îÄ Review output and results
   ‚îî‚îÄ Version control any changes

4. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Use Claude for git operations
   ‚îî‚îÄ Commit results
   ‚îî‚îÄ Create meaningful commit messages
   ‚îî‚îÄ Manage branches and PRs
```

### Anti-Pattern to Avoid

```
‚ùå DON'T:
1. Ask AI to describe what script does
2. Manually construct complex commands
3. Run scripts without input files
4. Skip version control of configurations
```

## üîÑ Application Across Repositories

### This Pattern Applies To:

1. **worldenergydata**
   - BSEE production analysis
   - Lower Tertiary NPV calculations
   - Marine safety incident analysis
   - All modular analysis workflows

2. **All workspace-hub repositories**
   - Any repository with scripts/ directory
   - Any YAML-based configuration system
   - Any analysis or data processing workflows
   - Git operations across all repos

3. **Future repositories**
   - Establish scripts/ + config/input/ structure
   - Create YAML templates
   - Build bash execution framework
   - Follow same best practices

### Universal Principles:

1. **Configuration as Code**: Always use input files over hardcoded parameters
2. **AI-Assisted Execution**: Let AI prepare both input and commands
3. **Git Integration**: Use Claude for git operations
4. **Version Control**: Track inputs, outputs, and configurations
5. **Avoid Descriptions**: Execute, don't describe

---

## üìù Repository-Specific Examples

### Example 1: Data Analysis Repository

```bash
# ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê BEST: AI prepares config + provides command
# AI creates: config/input/custom_analysis.yaml
# AI provides:
./scripts/run_analysis.sh reports/custom_output

# ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê GOOD: User prepares config, runs with input
./scripts/run_analysis.sh reports/output

# ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê OK: Run with defaults
./scripts/run_analysis.sh

# ‚ùå BAD: Ask AI to describe what the script does
"What does run_analysis.sh do?"
```

### Example 2: Git Workflow

```bash
# ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê BEST: Claude handles everything
# Claude executes:
git checkout -b feature/new-module
git add scripts/ config/ docs/
git commit -m "Add new module with YAML config"
git push -u origin feature/new-module
gh pr create --title "New Module"

# ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê OK: Manual git operations
# User manually types each command
# More error-prone, slower
```
