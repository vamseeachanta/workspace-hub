## Deployment Priority Ranking

### 🥇 TIER 1 - START HERE (Days 1-2)

| # | Repo | Size | Tests | Risk | Time |
|---|------|------|-------|------|------|
| 1 | **pyproject-starter** | 7.7 MB | ✅ 2 | 🟢 Low | 1 day |
| 2 | **ai-native-traditional-eng** | 12 MB | ✅ 1 | 🟢 Low | 1-2 days |

**Why First**: Reference implementations, smallest, already have tests

---

### 🥈 TIER 2 - HIGH PRIORITY (Days 2-8)

| # | Repo | Size | Tests | Risk | Time |
|---|------|------|-------|------|------|
| 3 | **frontierdeepwater** | 490 MB | ✅ 1 | 🟢 Low | 2-3 days |
| 4 | **energy** | 5.4 GB | ✅ 1 | 🟢 Low | 2-3 days |
| 5 | **seanation** | 1.5 GB | ✅ 1 | 🟢 Low | 2-3 days |
| 6 | **doris** | 521 MB | ✅ 1 | 🟢 Low | 2-3 days |

**Why Second**: Smoke tests exist, good size distribution, low risk

---

### 🥉 TIER 3 - MEDIUM PRIORITY (Days 8-15)

| # | Repo | Size | Tests | Risk | Time |
|---|------|------|-------|------|------|
| 7 | **rock-oil-field** | 5.2 GB | ❌ 0 | 🟡 Medium | 4-5 days |
| 8 | **saipem** | 4.1 GB | ❌ 0 | 🟡 Medium | 4-5 days |
| 9 | **aceengineer-website** | 281 MB | ❌ 0 | 🟡 Medium | 3-4 days |
| 10 | **aceengineer-admin** | 821 MB | ❌ 0 | 🟡 Medium | 3-4 days |

**Why Third**: No tests (need bootstrap), medium risk, business logic analysis needed

---

### ⚠️ TIER 4 - INVESTIGATION REQUIRED (Days 15+)

| # | Repo | Size | Tests | Risk | Time |
|---|------|------|-------|------|------|
| 11 | **OGManufacturing** | 2.4 GB | ❌ 0 | 🔴 High | 5-7 days |
| 12 | **client_projects** | 13 GB | ❌ 0 | 🔴 High | 6-8 days |

**Why Last**: Complex architecture, meta-repositories, need clarification before deployment

---

## Key Findings

### ✅ What We Have
- **All 12 repos are Git repositories** with active main branches
- **All 12 have pyproject.toml** (Python project structure)
- **All 12 have tests/ directories** (ready for testing framework)
- **All 12 have Python 3.9+** (consistent Python version)
- **5 repos already have smoke tests** (energy, frontierdeepwater, seanation, doris, ai-native-traditional-eng)

### ⚠️ What We Need
- **pytest.ini** - Configuration files for all 12 repos (30 min × 12 = 6 hours)
- **.coveragerc** - Coverage configuration for all 12 repos (30 min × 12 = 6 hours)
- **conftest.py** - Test fixtures and setup for all 12 repos (1 hour × 12 = 12 hours)
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Testing workflows for all 12 repos (1 hour × 12 = 12 hours)

### ❌ Special Issues
- **aceengineer-website** - Currently on `flask-backup` branch (not main) ⚠️
- **OGManufacturing** - Contains submodule references to other repos 🚩
- **client_projects** - Largest repo (13 GB), multi-project structure 🚩
