## Summary

Discussion about Vamsee's AI platform memberships and exploration of agentic development tools, transitioning from VS Code to newer AI-powered IDEs.

---

## Paid Memberships

- **Claude (Anthropic)** - Paid subscription (USD 106.6 per month, Max Plan)
- **OpenAI** - Paid subscription  ChatGPT Plus Subscription ($21.28 per month)
- **Google AI Pro** - AI Pro subscription (US$19.99/month)
- **GitHub Copilot Pro** - Paid subscription (USD 106.6 per year)

## Development Tools Explored

### Current/Previous Tools
- **VS Code** - Primary IDE being transitioned from

### Tools Briefly Used
- **Claude-flow** - Multi-agent orchestration framework for coordinating Claude instances on complex workflows. More DIY/developer-focused approach to building agent systems.
- **Factory.ai** - Agent-native platform with "Droids" that automate coding, testing, and deployment. Works across IDEs, CLI, Slack, and Linear. Supports multi-model (Claude, GPT, Gemini) with no vendor lock-in. Enterprise-focused with SOC 2 compliance.

### Currently Setting Up
- **Google Antigravity** - Google's new agentic development platform (launched November 2025)

---

## Google Antigravity - Key Details

### Overview
- Agent-first IDE powered by Gemini 3 Pro
- Built on VS Code foundation (familiar interface)
- Free during public preview period
- Available on Mac, Windows, and Linux

### Key Features

1. **Multi-Model Support**
   - Gemini 3 Pro
   - Claude Sonnet 4.5
   - GPT-OSS
   - Switch between models for different tasks

2. **Two Main Views**
   - **Editor View**: Traditional IDE experience with tab completions and inline commands
   - **Manager View**: Agent-first interface for dispatching multiple agents simultaneously

3. **Agentic Capabilities**
   - Agents operate across editor, terminal, and browser
   - Autonomous planning, execution, and verification
   - Browser automation for testing and validation
   - Generates artifacts (screenshots, walkthroughs) for review

4. **Learning System**
   - Knowledge base that learns from feedback
   - Saves useful context and code snippets for future tasks

### Getting Started Recommendations

1. Start with Editor View (familiar VS Code-like experience)
2. Try Manager View for agentic tasks
3. Test multi-model switching to find best fit for domain
4. Import VS Code settings for seamless transition

## Tool Comparison Summary

| Tool | Philosophy | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Claude-flow | Low-level agent orchestration | DIY multi-agent workflows |
| Factory.ai | Embed agents in existing workflow | Enterprise, CI/CD automation |
| Antigravity | Full IDE replacement, agent-first | Comprehensive agentic development |

---

## Status

- Antigravity IDE: Set up, not yet actively used
- Ready to explore and compare against previous tools

---

## Next Steps for Analysis

- [ ] Test Editor View with familiar VS Code workflows
- [ ] Try Manager View with a sample project
- [ ] Compare multi-model performance (Gemini vs Claude vs GPT)
- [ ] Evaluate against Factory.ai and claude-flow experience
- [ ] Test browser automation features
- [ ] Assess for marine engineering/OrcaFlex workflow suitability
