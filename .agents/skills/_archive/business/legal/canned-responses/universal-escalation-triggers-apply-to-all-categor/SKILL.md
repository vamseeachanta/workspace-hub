## When an Escalation Trigger is Detected


1. **Stop**: Do not generate a templated response
2. **Alert**: Inform the user that an escalation trigger has been detected
3. **Explain**: Describe which trigger was detected and why it matters
4. **Recommend**: Suggest the appropriate escalation path (senior counsel, outside counsel, specific team member)
5. **Offer**: Provide a draft for counsel review (clearly marked as "DRAFT - FOR COUNSEL REVIEW ONLY") rather than a final response
