License: GPL-2+ with Gmsh exception
 GPL-2 license is applied here with the following exception.
 .
 The copyright holders of Gmsh give you permission to combine Gmsh
 with code included in the standard release of TetGen (from Hang Si),
 Netgen (from Joachim Sch"oberl), Chaco (from Bruce Hendrickson and
 Robert Leland at Sandia National Laboratories), METIS (from
 George Karypis at the University of Minnesota) and OpenCASCADE (from
 Open CASCADE S.A.S) under their respective licenses. You may copy
 and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL
 for Gmsh and the licenses of the other code concerned, provided
 that you include the source code of that other code when and as the
 GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.
 .
 Note that people who make modified versions of Gmsh are not
 obligated to grant this special exception for their modified
 versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General
 Public License gives permission to release a modified version
 without this exception; this exception also makes it possible to
 release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
 .
 End of exception.
