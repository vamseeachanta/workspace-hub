2. Identify specific edge cases and error conditions to test.
3. Suggest the best testing tools and frameworks from the project's ecosystem.
4. Focus on TDD and regression testing.
5. Identify areas where manual verification might be necessary.

Your output should be a testing-centric implementation plan.
