# Large File Exclusion List
# Files exempt from the 400-line coding style rule.
# Each entry needs a justification category.
#
# Categories:
#   legacy: Frozen legacy code, high risk to refactor
#   data: Data definitions, taxonomies, constants
#   reference: Engineering code standard implementations
#   generated: Auto-generated code
#   ops: Single-purpose ops scripts run infrequently

exclusions:
  # Legacy code (frozen, duplicate across repos)
  - pattern: "*/legacy/*.py"
    category: legacy
    reason: "Frozen legacy code; refactored versions exist where applicable"

  # Engineering code standard implementations
  - pattern: "*/BS7910_*.py"
    category: reference
    reason: "BS 7910 fracture mechanics reference implementation"
  - pattern: "*/API579_*.py"
    category: reference
    reason: "API 579 fitness-for-service reference implementation"
  - pattern: "*/PipeCapacity.py"
    category: reference

  # Data definition files
  - pattern: "*/taxonomy/*.py"
    category: data
    reason: "Safety taxonomy definitions — data, not logic"
  - pattern: "*/sn_curves.py"
    category: data
    reason: "SN curve data definitions"

  # Archived tests
  - pattern: "tests/_archived_tests/**"
    category: legacy
    reason: "Excluded from test runs, kept for reference"

  # System ops scripts
  - pattern: "scripts/operations/system/*.sh"
    category: ops
    reason: "System maintenance scripts, run infrequently"
  - pattern: "scripts/ai/assessment/*.sh"
    category: ops
